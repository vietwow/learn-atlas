          "content": "<h3>1. What a game is</h3>\n<p>Game theory is the study of <b>strategic interaction</b>: situations where your best move depends on what others do, and theirs depends on you. A <em>game</em> has three ingredients — <b>players</b> (the decision-makers), <b>strategies</b> (the choices each can make), and <b>payoffs</b> (how much each player values every possible outcome). That's it; from those three pieces an astonishing amount follows.</p>\n<h3>2. The payoff matrix</h3>\n<p>For two players with a few strategies each, the whole game fits in a <b>payoff matrix</b>. The most famous is the <b>Prisoner's Dilemma</b>: two suspects are interrogated separately and each can stay <em>silent</em> (cooperate with each other) or <em>confess</em> (betray). Each cell shows (row player's payoff, column player's payoff) as years of freedom lost — so bigger is better, and 0 is best:</p>\n<table class=\"payoff\"><caption>Prisoner's Dilemma — payoffs are (A, B), higher is better</caption>\n<thead><tr><th></th><th>B: stay silent</th><th>B: confess</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><th>A: stay silent</th><td>−1, −1</td><td>−10, 0</td></tr>\n<tr><th>A: confess</th><td>0, −10</td><td>−5, −5</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>3. Dominant and dominated strategies</h3>\n<p>A strategy is <b>dominant</b> if it is your best choice <em>no matter</em> what the other player does. Look at player A: if B stays silent, confessing (0) beats silence (−1); if B confesses, confessing (−5) beats silence (−10). Confessing wins in <em>both</em> columns — so \"confess\" strictly <b>dominates</b> \"stay silent.\" The game is symmetric, so confessing dominates for B too. A rational player always plays a dominant strategy and never plays a <b>dominated</b> one.</p>\n<h3>4. Iterated elimination</h3>\n<p>Few games have an outright dominant strategy, but you can often <em>shrink</em> a game by repeatedly deleting dominated strategies — if a choice is never best, assume no one plays it, then re-examine what's left. This <b>iterated elimination of dominated strategies</b> sometimes solves a game outright and otherwise narrows it down before you reach for stronger tools.</p>\n<h3>5. Nash equilibrium</h3>\n<p>The central solution concept is the <b>Nash equilibrium</b>: a combination of strategies where <em>no player can do better by unilaterally changing their own move</em>, holding everyone else's fixed. It's a \"no regrets\" state — given what everyone else did, you're already playing your best response. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, (confess, confess) is the unique Nash equilibrium: from there, switching to silence would drop A from −5 to −10. John Nash proved that <em>every</em> finite game has at least one such equilibrium (allowing randomized strategies).</p>\n<h3>6. The tragedy: Nash ≠ best for all</h3>\n<p>Here is the sting. The Nash outcome (confess, confess) gives each player −5 — yet if both had stayed silent they'd get −1 <em>each</em>. Mutual silence is strictly better for everyone, but it is <b>unstable</b>: each player is individually tempted to defect. Rational self-interest drives both to a collectively worse outcome. This gap between the equilibrium and the mutually-best outcome — between <em>individual</em> and <em>collective</em> rationality — is the engine behind tragedies of the commons, arms races, and price wars.</p>\n<h3>7. Why this is everywhere in AI</h3>\n<p>Strategic interaction is woven through modern AI. A <a href=\"#/lesson/deep-learning/dl-gans\" data-route>GAN</a> is literally a two-player <em>minimax</em> game between a generator and a discriminator. <b>Multi-agent reinforcement learning</b> studies agents whose rewards depend on each other. <b>Adversarial examples</b> are an attacker–defender game; <b>robustness</b> training is its equilibrium. <b>Mechanism design</b> — game theory run backwards — builds the ad auctions that fund the web and the incentive rules behind crowd-sourced data. Even <b>alignment</b> is a principal–agent game between humans and a capable optimizer. Learning to think in players, strategies, and payoffs is a genuine AI superpower.</p>\n<h3>8. Summary</h3>\n<p>A game is players × strategies × payoffs. A dominant strategy wins in every column; a Nash equilibrium is a state no one can unilaterally improve on; and the Prisoner's Dilemma shows the two can conspire to a collectively bad outcome. These ideas scale from two prisoners to the largest multi-agent AI systems.</p>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: mixed strategies and why a Nash equilibrium always exists</summary>\n<p>Some games have <em>no</em> equilibrium in pure (deterministic) strategies — think rock-paper-scissors, where whatever you always-play can be exploited. The fix is a <b>mixed strategy</b>: a probability distribution over your choices (e.g. each of rock/paper/scissors with probability one-third). Nash's celebrated 1950 theorem says that <em>every</em> finite game has at least one equilibrium once mixed strategies are allowed. The proof is a fixed-point argument (Brouwer/Kakutani): the \"best-response\" map must have a fixed point, and a fixed point of best-response <em>is</em> an equilibrium. At a mixed equilibrium each player is <em>indifferent</em> among the strategies they mix — which is exactly what makes the opponent unable to exploit them.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: Nash vs Pareto — stable is not the same as good</summary>\n<p>An outcome is <b>Pareto-optimal</b> if no one can be made better off without making someone worse off. A <b>Nash equilibrium</b> is merely <em>stable</em> — no one can improve <em>unilaterally</em>. These are different axes, and the Prisoner's Dilemma is the canonical case where they collide: (confess, confess) is the unique Nash equilibrium but is Pareto-<em>dominated</em> by (silent, silent). Stability does not imply efficiency. Much of applied game theory — contracts, treaties, protocol design, mechanism design — is the art of <em>reshaping payoffs</em> so that the stable outcome is also the good one (e.g. repeated play, reputation, or binding penalties can make cooperation a Nash equilibrium).</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: zero-sum games, minimax, and the link to GANs</summary>\n<p>In a <b>zero-sum</b> game one player's gain is exactly the other's loss. Von Neumann's <b>minimax theorem</b> (1928) showed such games have a well-defined value: the most you can guarantee by maximizing your worst case equals the least your opponent can hold you to — <em>max-min = min-max</em>. That single fixed value is why two-player zero-sum games are \"solvable,\" and it underlies game-playing AI from minimax search to self-play. It is also the backbone of <a href=\"#/lesson/deep-learning/dl-gans\" data-route>GANs</a>: the generator and discriminator play a minimax game, and training seeks its equilibrium — which is why GAN training inherits all the instability of chasing a saddle point rather than descending to a minimum.</p>\n</details>\n<h3>Try it: find the dominant strategy</h3>\n<p>A strategy dominates if it beats every alternative in every column. Run this to detect a strictly dominant row:</p>\n<div data-code=\"javascript\" data-expected=\"dominant row: 0\">// A payoff matrix for the ROW player. Is there a row that is best in EVERY column?\nconst A = [[3, 2], [1, 0]];   // row 0 vs row 1, across two columns\nfunction dominantRow(M) {\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; M.length; i++) {\n    let dom = true;\n    for (let j = 0; j &lt; M.length; j++) if (j !== i)\n      for (let c = 0; c &lt; M[i].length; c++) if (M[i][c] &lt;= M[j][c]) dom = false;\n    if (dom) return i;   // row i beats every other row in every column\n  }\n  return -1;             // no strictly dominant row\n}\nconsole.log(\"dominant row: \" + dominantRow(A));   // row 0: 3>1 and 2>0</div>",
