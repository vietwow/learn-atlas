          "content": "<h3>1. The hook: data with a clock</h3>\n<p>Most datasets are a bag of independent rows — shuffle them and nothing changes. A <b>time series</b> is different: it is a sequence of observations <em>indexed in time order</em> (daily sales, hourly temperature, a heartbeat trace), and the order <em>is</em> the information. Yesterday tells you about today; the gap between points is meaningful; and you can only ever train on the past to predict the future. That single constraint — time flows one way — reshapes everything from how you split the data to which models work.</p>\n<h3>2. The four components</h3>\n<p>A classical lens decomposes a series into four parts. <b>Trend</b>: the slow, long-term drift in the level (a business growing year over year). <b>Seasonality</b>: a pattern that repeats over a <em>fixed</em> period (more ice cream every summer, more traffic every weekday). <b>Cyclic</b>: longer swings with <em>no</em> fixed period (business cycles, booms and busts). <b>Residual</b> (noise): what's left after the structure is removed. Separating these is the first thing any forecaster does.</p>\n<h3>3. Decomposition: additive vs multiplicative</h3>\n<p>How do the components combine? <b>Additive</b>: $y_t = \\text{Trend}_t + \\text{Season}_t + \\text{Residual}_t$ — the seasonal swing is a roughly constant size regardless of the level. <b>Multiplicative</b>: $y_t = \\text{Trend}_t \\times \\text{Season}_t \\times \\text{Residual}_t$ — the swing <em>grows with the level</em> (December sales spike harder every year as the business grows). A logarithm turns a multiplicative series into an additive one ($\\log$ of a product is a sum), which is why analysts so often model $\\log y_t$.</p>\n<div data-viz=\"ts-decomposition\"></div>\n<h3>4. Smoothing: the moving average</h3>\n<p>The simplest way to see the trend through the noise is a <b>moving average</b> — replace each point with the average of a small window around it. Run a window-3 average over a short series:</p>\n<div data-code=\"javascript\" data-expected=\"11, 12, 13, 14, 15\">// A simple moving average (window 3) smooths noise and exposes the trend\nconst series = [10, 12, 11, 13, 15, 14, 16];\nfunction movingAverage(x, w) {\n  const out = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i + w <= x.length; i++) {\n    let s = 0;\n    for (let j = i; j < i + w; j++) s += x[j];\n    out.push(s / w);\n  }\n  return out;\n}\nconsole.log(movingAverage(series, 3).join(\", \"));\n// The wiggles shrink; the upward drift becomes clear.</div>\n<h3>5. The forecasting task</h3>\n<p><b>Forecasting</b> is predicting future values from past observations: given $y_1,\\dots,y_t$, estimate $y_{t+1}, y_{t+2}, \\dots$ The defining rule is that the future must stay unseen during training. You cannot shuffle and randomly hold out points the way you would for ordinary data — the test set has to be a <em>contiguous block at the end</em>, and any feature must be computable from information available <em>before</em> the time it predicts. Break that and you leak the future into the past.</p>\n<h3>6. Why a time series isn't i.i.d.</h3>\n<p>Standard ML assumes examples are independent and identically distributed. Time series violate this on both counts: consecutive points are <b>autocorrelated</b> (today is close to yesterday), and the distribution itself drifts (the mean and variance change over time). Autocorrelation is not a nuisance — it is the very signal a forecaster exploits. But it also means naive cross-validation, bootstrapping, and \"shuffle then split\" are all <em>wrong</em> here.</p>\n<h3>7. Stationarity (a preview)</h3>\n<p>Many classical methods assume the series is <b>stationary</b> — its statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation structure) don't change over time. Real series rarely are: they trend and they have seasons. The classical workflow is therefore to <em>transform</em> a series toward stationarity (remove the trend by <b>differencing</b> $y_t - y_{t-1}$, stabilize the variance with a log), model the stationary remainder, then invert the transforms to forecast. We'll devote a full lesson to it.</p>\n<h3>8. Where it matters</h3>\n<p>Time series are everywhere: demand and inventory, electricity load, server metrics and anomaly detection, sensor streams, epidemiology, and finance. The classical toolkit (smoothing, ARIMA) still wins on small, regular data; modern deep forecasters (RNNs, temporal convolutions, state-space models, and transformers) take over when you have many related series and rich covariates. This topic builds from the classical foundations to those modern methods — and it is the natural companion to the sequence models you met in Deep Learning and LLMs.</p>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: additive or multiplicative? the log trick</summary>\n<p>The test is simple: look at the seasonal swings. If they stay a <em>constant size</em> as the trend rises, the series is <b>additive</b> ($y_t = T_t + S_t + R_t$). If they <em>grow in proportion</em> to the level — each year's December spike is taller than the last — it is <b>multiplicative</b> ($y_t = T_t \\times S_t \\times R_t$). The elegant fix for the multiplicative case is the logarithm: since $\\log(T_t \\times S_t \\times R_t) = \\log T_t + \\log S_t + \\log R_t$, taking logs converts a multiplicative series into an additive one, so all the additive machinery (and constant-width seasonal terms) applies to $\\log y_t$. This is why financial and demand series are so often modelled in log space.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: never shuffle a time series</summary>\n<p>The single most common time-series mistake is using ordinary k-fold cross-validation, which shuffles rows into random folds. That trains on future points to predict past ones — <b>temporal leakage</b> — and produces a glowing validation score that collapses in production. The fix is <b>forward-chaining</b> (rolling-origin) validation: train on $[1..k]$, test on $k+1$; then train on $[1..k+1]$, test on $k+2$; and so on. The test point is always strictly in the future of the training window. The same discipline applies to features: a \"30-day average\" feature for day $t$ must use only days before $t$, never a window centred on $t$.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: autocorrelation — a series correlated with its own past</summary>\n<p><b>Autocorrelation</b> at lag $k$ is the correlation between the series and a copy of itself shifted by $k$ steps. The plot of these values (the <b>ACF</b>) is the fingerprint of a time series: a slow decay signals a trend; a spike every 7 lags reveals weekly seasonality; near-zero everywhere means the series is essentially noise (white noise) with nothing to forecast. Autocorrelation is what makes a series <em>predictable at all</em> — and measuring it is how you decide which model, and how many lags, to use. It is the time-domain cousin of the covariance ideas from Probability &amp; Statistics.</p>\n</details>",

          "content": "<h3>1. The hook: methods want a stable world</h3>\n<p>Most classical forecasting tools assume the series isn't a moving target — that the way it behaves <em>this</em> year is the way it behaved last year. That property is <b>stationarity</b>. A trending or seasonal series breaks it, and fitting a model to a non-stationary series gives unstable, often spurious results. So the classical workflow is: transform the series toward stationarity, model the stable remainder, then invert the transforms to forecast.</p>\n<h3>2. What stationarity means</h3>\n<p>A series is (weakly) <b>stationary</b> if its first two moments are constant over time: a constant <b>mean</b> (no trend), a constant <b>variance</b> (no growing swings), and an <b>autocovariance</b> that depends only on the lag $k$, not on <em>when</em> you look. Intuitively: slide a window along the series and the statistics you measure don't change. White noise is the simplest stationary series; a trending sales curve is not.</p>\n<h3>3. Why non-stationarity breaks things</h3>\n<p>If the mean drifts, \"the average\" is meaningless — it depends on the window. Worse, two unrelated trending series can show a high correlation purely because both rise over time: a <b>spurious regression</b>. Estimates of variance and autocorrelation become unstable, confidence intervals are wrong, and a model tuned on one stretch fails on the next. Stationarity is what makes the past a reliable guide to the future.</p>\n<h3>4. Differencing removes a trend</h3>\n<p>The workhorse fix is <b>differencing</b>: replace the series with its step-to-step changes, $\\nabla y_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$. A linear trend becomes a constant; a constant becomes zero. Difference a perfectly linear series and watch the trend vanish:</p>\n<div data-code=\"javascript\" data-expected=\"2, 2, 2, 2, 2\">// First differencing: y[t] - y[t-1] turns a trend into a (stationary) constant\nconst y = [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20];   // a perfectly linear upward trend\nconst diff = [];\nfor (let i = 1; i < y.length; i++) diff.push(y[i] - y[i - 1]);\nconsole.log(diff.join(\", \"));\n// The rising trend is gone; the differenced series is flat (constant mean).</div>\n<h3>5. Seasonal differencing</h3>\n<p>A repeating seasonal pattern of period $m$ is removed by <b>seasonal differencing</b>: $y_t - y_{t-m}$ (e.g. subtract last year's same month, $m=12$). This cancels the seasonal term the way ordinary differencing cancels a trend. Many real series need both — one ordinary difference for the trend and one seasonal difference for the season.</p>\n<h3>6. Stabilizing the variance</h3>\n<p>Differencing fixes a drifting <em>mean</em>, but not a drifting <em>variance</em> (swings that grow with the level). For that, transform before differencing: a <b>log</b> (or the more general Box–Cox) shrinks large values more than small ones, turning multiplicative, fanning-out behaviour into something roughly additive with constant spread. Log first, then difference.</p>\n<h3>7. Testing for stationarity</h3>\n<p>Eyeballing a plot of the rolling mean and rolling variance is the first check — flat lines suggest stationarity. The formal tool is the <b>Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test</b>, which tests for a <b>unit root</b> (the signature of a random-walk-like non-stationary series); rejecting its null is evidence the series is stationary. The point isn't the test statistic — it's deciding how many differences the series needs.</p>\n<h3>8. Putting it together: the \"d\" in ARIMA</h3>\n<p>This is exactly the integrated part of <b>ARIMA(p, d, q)</b>: $d$ is the number of differences applied to make the series stationary before an ARMA model is fit, and the forecast is then \"un-differenced\" (cumulatively summed) back to the original scale. Get $d$ right — usually 0, 1, or 2 — and the rest of the modelling stands on solid ground. We build ARIMA itself in a later lesson.</p>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: strict vs weak (covariance) stationarity</summary>\n<p><b>Strict</b> stationarity demands that the <em>entire</em> joint distribution of any block of points is unchanged when you shift it in time — a very strong condition. In practice we almost always use <b>weak</b> (or covariance) stationarity, which only constrains the first two moments: constant mean, constant (finite) variance, and an autocovariance $\\gamma(k)$ that depends solely on the lag $k$. For a Gaussian process the two notions coincide (a Gaussian is fully described by its mean and covariance), which is one reason weak stationarity is the working definition: it is exactly what the classical linear methods (AR, MA, ARMA) actually require.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: unit roots and the random walk</summary>\n<p>The canonical non-stationary series is the <b>random walk</b> $y_t = y_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t$. Its variance grows without bound ($\\text{Var}(y_t) = t\\,\\sigma^2$), so it has no fixed level — it wanders. In the model $y_t = \\phi\\,y_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t$, stationarity requires $|\\phi| < 1$; the random walk sits exactly at $\\phi = 1$, the <b>unit root</b>, on the boundary. The beautiful part: one difference of a random walk, $y_t - y_{t-1} = \\varepsilon_t$, is pure white noise — perfectly stationary. That is why \"difference once\" so often works: it removes a single unit root.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: don't over-difference</summary>\n<p>Differencing is not free — each difference throws away a data point and injects new autocorrelation. <b>Over-differencing</b> (differencing an already-stationary series) is a real mistake: it inflates the variance and creates artificial negative autocorrelation at lag 1 (an unnecessary MA term), making the model harder to fit and the forecasts noisier. The discipline is to use the <em>smallest</em> $d$ that achieves stationarity — check after each difference (plot, ADF) and stop as soon as the trend is gone. Usually $d \\le 2$; needing more is a sign something else (like a missed log transform) is wrong.</p>\n</details>",

The <b>drift</b> forecast: extend the line from first to last point. They sound trivial, but a model that can't beat them isn't worth shipping — they are the bar.</p>\n<h3>2.

Here with $\\alpha = 0.5$:</p>\n<div data-code=\"javascript\" data-expected=\"10, 11, 12, 12, 13.5\">// Simple exponential smoothing: blend the new point with the running estimate\nconst y = [10, 12, 13, 12, 15];\nconst alpha = 0.5;\nlet s = y[0];                  // start at the first observation\nconst out = [s];\nfor (let t = 1; t < y.length; t++) {\n  s = alpha * y[t] + (1 - alpha) * s;   // weight recent more\n  out.push(+s.toFixed(2));\n}\nconsole.log(out.join(\", \"));\n// The smoothed level tracks the data while filtering the jitter.</div>\n<h3>5. The smoothing parameter α</h3>\n<p>$\\alpha$ is the responsiveness dial. Near <b>1</b>, the forecast chases the latest value (fast to react, but noisy — almost the naive forecast). Near <b>0</b>, it is sluggish and very smooth (almost the long-run mean). In practice $\\alpha$ is <em>fit</em> by choosing the value that minimizes one-step forecast error on the history — a tiny optimization, not a guess.</p>\n<h3>6. Holt's method: adding a trend</h3>\n<p>Plain SES forecasts a flat line — it has no notion of direction, so it lags a trend. <b>Holt's linear method</b> fixes this by smoothing <em>two</em> things: the <b>level</b> and a separate <b>trend</b> (slope), each with its own parameter. The forecast then extrapolates the current level along the current slope, so it keeps up with a rising or falling series.</p>\n<h3>7. Holt–Winters: adding seasonality</h3>\n<p><b>Holt–Winters</b> adds a third smoothed component — the <b>seasonal</b> indices — giving three equations (level, trend, season) and a forecast that carries trend <em>and</em> the repeating pattern forward. It comes in additive and multiplicative flavours, matching the decomposition choice from the first lesson. This is the classic, robust workhorse for seasonal business data.</p>\n<h3>8. When to reach for it</h3>\n<p>Exponential smoothing (the ETS family) is fast, needs little data, is hard to overfit, and produces strong baselines — often competitive with far heavier models on regular business series. Its limits: it captures level/trend/season but not complex dynamics, external drivers, or long-range dependence. Use it as the baseline every richer model (ARIMA, deep forecasters) must beat.</p>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: why \"exponential\"? the geometric weights</summary>\n<p>Unroll the recursion $\\hat{y}_{t+1} = \\alpha y_t + (1-\\alpha)\\hat{y}_t$ and it becomes a weighted sum of <em>all</em> past observations: $\\hat{y}_{t+1} = \\alpha y_t + \\alpha(1-\\alpha) y_{t-1} + \\alpha(1-\\alpha)^2 y_{t-2} + \\cdots$ The weight on the point $j$ steps back is $\\alpha(1-\\alpha)^j$ — it shrinks <b>geometrically</b> (exponentially) with age, and the weights sum to 1. So unlike a moving average's hard window with equal weights, SES has an infinitely long but exponentially-fading memory. This is the identical idea behind the exponential moving averages in momentum/Adam optimizers and the running averages in RL — one recursive line, an exponentially-decaying memory.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: choosing α by minimizing error</summary>\n<p>You don't eyeball $\\alpha$. You pick the value that minimizes the sum of squared one-step-ahead forecast errors over the training history, $\\sum_t (y_t - \\hat{y}_t)^2$ — a 1-D optimization solved by grid search or a numerical optimizer. A large fitted $\\alpha$ tells you the series is dominated by recent shocks (little persistent structure); a small $\\alpha$ says the level is stable and old data still informs the present. The same principle scales up: Holt and Holt–Winters fit their two or three smoothing parameters jointly the same way.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: ETS, state-space, and the link to ARIMA</summary>\n<p>Modern software treats exponential smoothing as the <b>ETS</b> (Error, Trend, Seasonal) family of <em>state-space</em> models: a hidden state (level, trend, seasonal) evolves and emits the observation, which lets you fit by likelihood and get prediction intervals, not just point forecasts. Strikingly, several ETS models are <em>equivalent</em> to particular ARIMA models — e.g. simple exponential smoothing is the optimal forecast for an ARIMA(0,1,1). So ETS and ARIMA are two lenses on overlapping ground: ETS organizes models by components (trend/season), ARIMA by autocorrelation structure (AR/I/MA). Knowing both lets you pick the framing that fits the problem.</p>\n</details>",
