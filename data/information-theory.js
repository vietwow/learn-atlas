          "content": "<h3>1. The hook: how much does a message tell you?</h3>\n<p>If a friend texts \"the sun rose this morning,\" you learn almost nothing — you already knew. If they text \"it snowed in the Sahara,\" you learn a great deal. <strong>Information theory</strong>, founded by Claude Shannon in 1948, makes this precise: the information in an event is tied to how <em>surprising</em> it is. Rare events carry more information than certain ones. From this single idea flow entropy, data compression, and — directly — the loss functions that train every modern model.</p>\n<h3>2. Self-information: surprise, quantified</h3>\n<p>The <strong>self-information</strong> (or \"surprisal\") of an event with probability $p$ is $$I(x) = -\\log p(x) = \\log\\frac{1}{p(x)}.$$ A certain event ($p=1$) carries $I=0$ — no surprise, no information. A rare event ($p\\to 0$) carries $I\\to\\infty$. The rarer the event, the bigger the surprise. With $\\log$ base 2, $I$ is measured in <strong>bits</strong>: an event of probability $\\tfrac12$ carries exactly 1 bit (one yes/no answer's worth).</p>\n<h3>3. Entropy: average surprise</h3>\n<p><strong>Entropy</strong> is the <em>expected</em> self-information of a random variable — how surprising its outcomes are on average: $$H(X) = \\mathbb{E}[-\\log p(X)] = -\\sum_x p(x)\\log p(x).$$ It measures <em>uncertainty</em>: how unpredictable $X$ is, and equivalently how many bits you need, on average, to encode one outcome. A fair coin has $H=1$ bit; a fair six-sided die has $H=\\log_2 6\\approx 2.585$ bits. A loaded coin that lands heads 90% of the time has only $H\\approx 0.47$ bits — far more predictable, so far less information per flip.</p>\n<h3>4. Bits, nats, and the base of the log</h3>\n<p>The base of the logarithm only sets the <em>units</em>. Base 2 gives <strong>bits</strong> (the natural currency of yes/no questions and digital storage); base $e$ gives <strong>nats</strong> (the default in machine learning, because derivatives of $\\ln$ are clean); base 10 gives \"dits.\" They differ by a constant factor — 1 nat $=\\log_2 e\\approx 1.44$ bits — so every result is the same shape regardless of base. ML almost always uses nats; this lesson uses bits for intuition.</p>\n<h3>5. Maximum and minimum uncertainty</h3>\n<p>Entropy is bounded. It is <em>minimized</em> at $H=0$ when one outcome is certain ($p=1$) — no uncertainty, nothing to encode. It is <em>maximized</em> when every outcome is equally likely: for $n$ outcomes the uniform distribution gives $H=\\log_2 n$, the most bits any distribution over $n$ outcomes can have. Uniform = maximally uncertain; peaked = predictable. This is why a well-shuffled deck (uniform) is the hardest to guess and compresses the worst.</p>\n<h3>6. Compute it yourself</h3>\n<p><b>Try it in code.</b> Shannon entropy is a one-liner: sum $-p\\log_2 p$ over the outcomes. This distribution $[0.5, 0.25, 0.25]$ should come out to exactly 1.5 bits.</p>\n<div data-code=\"javascript\" data-expected=\"1.50\">// Shannon entropy H = -sum p*log2(p), in bits\nconst p = [0.5, 0.25, 0.25];\nconst log2 = x => Math.log(x) / Math.log(2);\nlet H = 0;\nfor (let i = p.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) H -= p[i] * log2(p[i]);\nconsole.log(H.toFixed(2));</div>\n<h3>7. Why this is the foundation of machine learning</h3>\n<p>Entropy is not abstract — it is the root of the tools you already use. <strong>Cross-entropy</strong>, the standard classification loss, measures the average surprise of the true labels under the model's predicted distribution; minimizing it makes the model less surprised by reality. <strong>KL divergence</strong> measures how many <em>extra</em> bits you pay for using the wrong distribution. <strong>Decision trees</strong> split on the feature that reduces entropy most (information gain). And a language model's <strong>perplexity</strong> is just $2^{H}$ — the entropy of its next-token guesses, exponentiated. Master entropy and these stop being formulas to memorize and become one idea.</p>\n<h3>8. The big picture</h3>\n<p>Information is surprise; entropy is average surprise, measured in bits (or nats). It quantifies uncertainty, sets the hard limit on lossless compression, and underlies cross-entropy, KL divergence, mutual information, and perplexity. Everything else in this subject is built on the simple act of taking $-\\log p$ and averaging it.</p>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: why the logarithm? Because information should add</summary>\n<p>Why define information as $-\\log p$ rather than, say, $1-p$? Because we want one property above all: the information from <em>independent</em> events should <em>add</em>. Learning two unrelated facts should give you the sum of their individual information.</p>\n<p>For independent events, probabilities <em>multiply</em>: $p(x,y)=p(x)\\,p(y)$. We want a measure $I$ with $I(x,y)=I(x)+I(y)$. The only function that turns multiplication into addition is the logarithm: $-\\log\\big(p(x)p(y)\\big)=-\\log p(x)-\\log p(y)$. So the log is not arbitrary — it is <em>forced</em> by the additivity requirement (plus continuity and \"rarer means more\"). Shannon proved these few axioms pin down $-\\log p$ uniquely, up to the choice of base.</p>\n<p>The \"aha\": the logarithm is the unique way to make \"surprise\" additive over independent events — which is exactly what makes bits compose (two coin flips carry 2 bits) and entropies of independent variables sum.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: entropy is the limit of lossless compression</summary>\n<p>Entropy is not just a feeling of \"uncertainty\" — it is a hard engineering limit. <strong>Shannon's source coding theorem</strong> says that to encode outcomes of $X$ losslessly, you need <em>on average at least $H(X)$ bits per symbol</em>, and you can get arbitrarily close to it. No scheme can do better; that is why entropy is measured in bits.</p>\n<p><b>The intuition.</b> Assign <em>short</em> codes to common outcomes and <em>long</em> codes to rare ones (Morse code does this — \"E\" is one dot). The optimal code length for an outcome of probability $p$ is about $-\\log_2 p$ bits — its self-information. Average those code lengths over the distribution and you get $H(X)$. Huffman coding and arithmetic coding are the practical algorithms that approach this bound.</p>\n<p>The \"aha\": entropy answers a concrete question — \"how small can this file get?\" A source of entropy $H$ cannot be compressed below $H$ bits per symbol on average. Predictability (low entropy) is exactly what makes compression possible, which is why a language model that predicts text well also <em>compresses</em> it well.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: why uniform maximizes entropy (and why it matters)</summary>\n<p>Among all distributions over $n$ outcomes, the <em>uniform</em> one has the highest entropy, $\\log_2 n$. Intuitively, spreading probability evenly leaves you maximally uncertain; concentrating it on a few outcomes makes them predictable and lowers $H$. (It follows from Jensen's inequality applied to the concave $\\log$.)</p>\n<p><b>The principle.</b> This is the basis of the <strong>maximum-entropy principle</strong>: when you must pick a distribution subject to some known constraints, choose the one with the highest entropy — it assumes the least beyond what you actually know. Fix only the mean and variance and max-entropy hands you the <em>Gaussian</em>; fix only the mean of a positive quantity and you get the <em>exponential</em>. Many \"natural\" distributions are simply the least-committal choice given a constraint.</p>\n<p>The \"aha\": maximum entropy is honest ignorance made precise — the flattest distribution consistent with what you know. It connects entropy to statistics (the Gaussian as max-entropy), to physics (thermodynamic equilibrium), and to ML (max-entropy / logistic models that avoid unwarranted assumptions).</p>\n</details>",

          "content": "<h3>1. The hook: comparing two distributions</h3>\n<p>Entropy measures the uncertainty in <em>one</em> distribution. But machine learning constantly asks a <em>comparison</em> question: my model predicts a distribution $q$; reality follows a distribution $p$. <em>How wrong is $q$?</em> Two quantities answer this — <strong>cross-entropy</strong> (how surprised $q$ is by $p$'s outcomes) and <strong>KL divergence</strong> (how many <em>extra</em> bits that wrongness costs). Together they are the most-used objects in all of ML: cross-entropy is the loss that trains nearly every classifier and language model.</p>\n<h3>2. Cross-entropy</h3>\n<p>Recall that the optimal code for a distribution uses about $-\\log q(x)$ bits for outcome $x$. <strong>Cross-entropy</strong> asks: if outcomes actually come from $p$ but you encode them with $q$'s code, what is your average bit cost? $$H(p,q) = -\\sum_x p(x)\\log q(x) = \\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim p}[-\\log q(x)].$$ It is the average surprise of $p$'s outcomes <em>measured by $q$</em>. When $q=p$ it reduces to the ordinary entropy $H(p)$.</p>\n<div data-viz=\"dl-cross-entropy\"></div>\n<h3>3. You can never beat the true distribution</h3>\n<p>A fundamental inequality: $$H(p,q)\\ge H(p),$$ with equality only when $q=p$. Using <em>any</em> code other than the one matched to reality costs you more bits on average — there is no free lunch. The gap between them is the price of being wrong, and it has a name.</p>\n<h3>4. KL divergence: the extra bits</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence</strong> is exactly that gap: $$D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p\\,\\|\\,q) = H(p,q) - H(p) = \\sum_x p(x)\\log\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}.$$ It measures the <em>extra</em> bits per symbol you pay for using $q$ when the truth is $p$ — the \"wasted surprise.\" So <strong>cross-entropy = entropy + KL</strong>: $H(p,q)=H(p)+D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p\\|q)$.</p>\n<div data-viz=\"dl-kl-divergence\"></div>\n<h3>5. KL is not a distance</h3>\n<p>KL has two key properties. It is <em>nonnegative</em>: $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p\\|q)\\ge 0$, and zero only when $p=q$ (this is Gibbs' inequality, the formal version of \"you can't beat the true code\"). But it is <em>not symmetric</em>: in general $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p\\|q)\\neq D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(q\\|p)$, and it violates the triangle inequality — so despite being called a \"divergence,\" it is <strong>not a true distance metric</strong>. The direction matters, and choosing which one to minimize changes the answer.</p>\n<h3>6. Compute it yourself</h3>\n<p><b>Try it in code.</b> KL is a weighted sum of log-ratios. For $p=[0.5,0.5]$ and $q=[0.9,0.1]$ it should come out near 0.74 bits — the price of modelling a fair coin as a biased one.</p>\n<div data-code=\"javascript\" data-expected=\"0.74\">// KL divergence D(p||q) = sum p*log2(p/q), in bits\nconst p = [0.5, 0.5], q = [0.9, 0.1];\nconst log2 = x => Math.log(x) / Math.log(2);\nlet kl = 0;\nfor (let i = p.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) kl += p[i] * log2(p[i] / q[i]);\nconsole.log(kl.toFixed(2));</div>\n<h3>7. Why this is the loss function</h3>\n<p>Here is the punchline. To train a classifier, $p$ is the true label (often a one-hot distribution) and $q$ is the model's predicted probabilities. Minimizing the <strong>cross-entropy</strong> $H(p,q)$ over the data is the standard loss. Because $H(p,q)=H(p)+D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p\\|q)$ and $H(p)$ doesn't depend on the model, <em>minimizing cross-entropy is exactly minimizing the KL divergence from your model to reality</em> — and it is mathematically identical to <strong>maximum-likelihood estimation</strong>. For a one-hot label the cross-entropy collapses to $-\\log q(\\text{true class})$, the familiar log-loss: confident-and-right costs almost nothing, confident-and-wrong costs a fortune.</p>\n<h3>8. The big picture</h3>\n<p>Cross-entropy is the average bits to encode reality $p$ with your model $q$; KL divergence is the <em>extra</em> bits over the unbeatable $H(p)$. They satisfy $H(p,q)=H(p)+D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p\\|q)$, with $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\ge 0$ and asymmetric. Minimizing cross-entropy = minimizing KL to the truth = maximum likelihood — which is why this one idea, born from coding theory, is the loss behind almost every model you will train.</p>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: minimizing cross-entropy IS maximum likelihood</summary>\n<p>Why is cross-entropy <em>the</em> loss, rather than one of many choices?

          "minutes": 18,
          "content": "<h3>1. The hook: how much does one variable tell you about another?</h3>\n<p>Entropy measures the uncertainty in a single variable; cross-entropy and KL compare two distributions. <strong>Mutual information</strong> answers a third, deeply practical question: if I learn $Y$, how many bits of uncertainty about $X$ do I lose? It quantifies the <em>shared information</em> between two variables — and unlike correlation, it captures <em>any</em> kind of dependence, linear or not.</p>\n<h3>2. Joint and conditional entropy</h3>\n<p>First we need entropy for pairs. The <strong>joint entropy</strong> $H(X,Y)=-\\sum_{x,y}p(x,y)\\log p(x,y)$ is the total uncertainty in the pair. The <strong>conditional entropy</strong> $H(X\\mid Y)=\\sum_y p(y)\\,H(X\\mid Y{=}y)$ is the uncertainty <em>remaining</em> in $X$ once you know $Y$. They satisfy the intuitive chain rule $$H(X,Y)=H(Y)+H(X\\mid Y):$$ the uncertainty in the pair is the uncertainty in $Y$ plus whatever is left in $X$ after seeing $Y$.</p>\n<h3>3. Mutual information: the uncertainty removed</h3>\n<p><strong>Mutual information</strong> is the drop in uncertainty about $X$ from learning $Y$: $$I(X;Y)=H(X)-H(X\\mid Y).$$ Equivalently, by the chain rule, $I(X;Y)=H(X)+H(Y)-H(X,Y)$ — and it is <em>symmetric</em>, $I(X;Y)=I(Y;X)$, so $Y$ tells you exactly as much about $X$ as $X$ tells you about $Y$. In its raw form it is a KL divergence between the joint and the product of marginals: $$I(X;Y)=\\sum_{x,y}p(x,y)\\log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)\\,p(y)} = D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\!\\big(p(x,y)\\,\\|\\,p(x)p(y)\\big).$$</p>\n<h3>4. Zero exactly when independent</h3>\n<p>That KL form makes a key fact obvious: $I(X;Y)\\ge 0$, and $I(X;Y)=0$ <em>if and only if</em> $X$ and $Y$ are independent (then $p(x,y)=p(x)p(y)$ and the log is zero). Any dependence at all — however nonlinear — gives positive mutual information. This is what makes MI a far more general measure of association than the correlation coefficient.</p>\n<h3>5. MI vs. correlation</h3>\n<p>Correlation only sees <em>linear</em> relationships. Two variables related by $Y=X^2$ (with $X$ symmetric around 0) have <em>zero</em> correlation yet are clearly dependent — and mutual information detects it, because knowing $X$ pins down $Y$. MI = 0 is the true test of independence; correlation = 0 is not. The price is that MI needs the full joint distribution (or a good estimate of it), which is harder to get than a correlation.</p>\n<h3>6. Compute it yourself</h3>\n<p><b>Try it in code.</b> For the correlated joint $p=\\begin{smallmatrix}0.4&0.1\\\\0.1&0.4\\end{smallmatrix}$ (marginals both fair), the mutual information is about 0.28 bits — that is how much one bit tells you about the other here.</p>\n<div data-code=\"javascript\" data-expected=\"0.28\">// Mutual information I(X;Y) = sum p(x,y) * log2( p(x,y) / (p(x)p(y)) )\nconst joint = [[0.4, 0.1], [0.1, 0.4]];\nconst px = [0.5, 0.5], py = [0.5, 0.5];   // row / column sums\nconst log2 = x => Math.log(x) / Math.log(2);\nlet I = 0;\nfor (let i = joint.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)\n  for (let j = joint[i].length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {\n    const p = joint[i][j];\n    if (p > 0) I += p * log2(p / (px[i] * py[j]));\n  }\nconsole.log(I.toFixed(2));</div>\n<h3>7. Where mutual information shows up</h3>\n<p>MI is everywhere in ML. <strong>Decision trees</strong> split on the feature with the highest <em>information gain</em> — which is exactly the mutual information between that feature and the label. <strong>Feature selection</strong> ranks features by their MI with the target. The <strong>information bottleneck</strong> frames learning as keeping the MI between a representation and the label while squeezing out MI with the raw input. And modern <strong>contrastive learning</strong> (InfoNCE) trains representations by maximizing a lower bound on the mutual information between different views of the same data.</p>\n<h3>8. The big picture</h3>\n<p>Mutual information is the shared uncertainty between two variables: $I(X;Y)=H(X)-H(X\\mid Y)=H(X)+H(Y)-H(X,Y)$, symmetric, nonnegative, and zero exactly when they are independent. It is the KL divergence between the joint and the product of marginals — a general, nonlinear measure of dependence that powers information gain, feature selection, the information bottleneck, and contrastive learning.</p>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: the information Venn diagram</summary>\n<p>The entropies of two variables fit together like a Venn diagram, and the set operations are <em>literally</em> the information identities.</p>\n<p>Picture two overlapping circles, one of area $H(X)$ and one of area $H(Y)$. Their <em>union</em> is the joint entropy $H(X,Y)$; their <em>intersection</em> is the mutual information $I(X;Y)$; and the part of $X$'s circle outside $Y$'s is the conditional entropy $H(X\\mid Y)$. Every identity drops out by reading the picture: $H(X,Y)=H(X)+H(Y)-I(X;Y)$ (union = sum minus intersection); $I(X;Y)=H(X)-H(X\\mid Y)$ (intersection = circle minus the part outside); $H(X\\mid Y)+I(X;Y)=H(X)$.</p>\n<p>The \"aha\": information quantities obey set algebra. Joint entropy is a union, conditional entropy is a set difference, and mutual information is the intersection — which is why it is symmetric and why \"total = each part plus the shared overlap, counted once\" just works. (The analogy has limits for three or more variables, where the \"interaction information\" can go negative, but for two it is exact.)</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: why MI beats correlation</summary>\n<p>Pearson correlation $\\rho$ measures one thing: the strength of a <em>linear</em> relationship. It is blind to everything else, and that blindness is dangerous.</p>\n<p><b>The classic trap.</b> Let $X$ be symmetric about 0 and $Y=X^2$. Then $Y$ is <em>completely determined</em> by $X$ — maximal dependence — yet $\\rho(X,Y)=0$, because the relationship is symmetric and non-monotonic. Anyone trusting correlation would call them unrelated. Mutual information, in contrast, is large: knowing $X$ removes all uncertainty about $Y$, so $I(X;Y)=H(Y)>0$. MI sees the dependence that correlation cannot.</p>\n<p><b>The general statement.</b> $\\rho=0$ does <em>not</em> imply independence (only the converse holds, and even that only loosely); but $I(X;Y)=0$ <em>does</em> imply independence, exactly. That is why MI is the gold-standard dependence measure when you can estimate it — at the cost of needing the joint distribution, whereas correlation needs only second moments.</p>\n<p>The \"aha\": correlation answers \"do they move together in a straight line?\"; mutual information answers \"does knowing one reduce uncertainty about the other, in any way at all?\" Only the second is a true test of independence.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"deep-dive\">\n<summary>Deeper dive: information gain in decision trees IS mutual information</summary>\n<p>Decision trees and information theory meet exactly here. A tree chooses, at each node, the feature that best \"purifies\" the labels — measured by <strong>information gain</strong>, the drop in label entropy from knowing the feature: $\\mathrm{IG}(Y;F)=H(Y)-H(Y\\mid F)$.</p>\n<p>That formula <em>is</em> the definition of mutual information, $I(Y;F)$. So \"split on the highest-information-gain feature\" means \"split on the feature that shares the most information with the label.\" A feature independent of the label has $I=0$ and is useless for splitting; a feature that determines the label has $I=H(Y)$ and splits it perfectly. The entropy-based impurity criterion (ID3, C4.5) is greedy mutual-information maximization, one node at a time.</p>\n<p>The \"aha\": the decision tree you met in Machine Learning was doing information theory all along — information gain is just mutual information between a candidate split and the target, which is why both fields define \"uncertainty reduced by knowing a feature\" the same way.</p>\n</details>",
