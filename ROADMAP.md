# Atlas — Roadmap

**North star:** the best *personal* learning site ever — for one motivated self-learner studying
linear algebra, calculus, algorithms, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and LLMs.
Optimize for: understanding faster, remembering longer, and *wanting* to come back.

The autonomous loop (`/improve-atlas`) reads this file first. Keep it the live queue:
done items move to CHANGELOG and out; new ideas land in the backlog.

## ★ OWNER DIRECTIVE (2026-06-17 — supersedes default rotation until delivered)
The owner reviewed the mature site and set the next arc. Rotate across these (biggest-value first):
1. **NEW SUBJECT: Probability & Statistics** — IN PROGRESS. ✅ iter 71: Foundations module (4 lessons +
   cards/homework/examples; Bayes viz embedded). ✅ iter 73: Common Distributions module (5 lessons). ✅ iter 74:
   CLT viz (`ps-clt`). ✅ iter 75: all 9 PS lessons now at 12 MCQs (108 topic / 1,464 site). NEXT for this topic:
   ✅ iter 76: normal-distribution explorer viz (`ps-normal-explorer`: μ/σ + empirical-rule bands + interval CDF).
   ✅ iter 77: Module 3 "Joint Distributions & Dependence" (3 lessons). ✅ iter 78: all 3 Module-3 lessons to 12
   MCQs (+36; topic now 144 / site 1,500). All 12 PS lessons now at 12 MCQs.
   ✅ iter 79: covariance/correlation scatter viz (`ps-covariance-scatter`, embedded in the covariance lesson).
   NEXT for this topic: more modules — Limit theorems (LLN/CLT formal), Estimation & confidence intervals,
   Hypothesis testing, Bayesian inference.
   ⚠ Lesson-authoring workflow bug (iter 71): the VERIFY agent overwrote `content` with its review notes for
   3/4 lessons. When authoring future lessons, make the verify schema/prompt EXPLICIT: "return the corrected
   LESSON HTML in `content`; put commentary ONLY in `notes`; never write a summary into `content`." (Recovered
   via transcript extraction this time.)
2. **Deepen the existing six** — add ADVANCED lessons/modules (not just more of the same; go further than the
   current depth) where each topic has frontier/advanced gaps.
3. **Hard-concept support** — for concepts that are hard to understand, add an EXTRA place/way to explain
   (e.g. a deeper-dive / "intuition" expandable, an alternative explanation), and SPLIT or MERGE lessons where
   that makes a concept land better.
4. **New learning functionality** is welcome too.
Verification: owner chose KEEP FULL verification (screenshot every view desktop+mobile + DOM-dump errs=0) —
but ALWAYS `pkill -f "Google Chrome.*--headless"` after each run so zombie Chrome can't accumulate (87 had
piled up by iter 70; cleaned). Wrap chrome in `timeout` too.

## Now (highest priority)
- **QUESTION BANK — phase 1 DONE (iters 7–9): all 6 topics at ~8 MCQs/lesson, bank 452 → 897.** Mastery mode
  (iter 6) recycles misses until passed. Standing low-priority job: keep topping up weak/thin lessons toward
  ~10/lesson over time, but this is no longer the lead — INTERLEAVE it with the rest of the compass now.
- **NOW INTERLEAVE (bank goal met):** rotate the compass each iteration — don't repeat an area twice running.
  - New visualizations for concepts that lack one: PCA/eigenbasis, convolution, MDP policy iteration, Bayes,
    RNN unrolling. (DONE: neural-net forward pass, attention heatmap, + the original 10.)
  - UI/animation polish & juice (confetti on level-up, XP-gain float, smoother transitions).
  - Onboarding/first-visit tour, better empty states, a hover-glossary of key terms.
  - (DONE iter 11: accessibility — reduced-motion, focus-visible, ARIA, skip link, live-region toasts.)

## Perf notes (iter 58)
First-load path optimized: all 13 data/logic scripts are `defer` (parallel fetch, ordered exec); fonts load
via a `<link>` (not a chained `@import`); `preconnect` to jsdelivr + Google Fonts. Remaining lever if load
ever feels heavy: the 6 topic data files total ~3.5 MB and are parsed eagerly — Pages already gzips them
(whitespace ≈ free on the wire), so the real cost is parse/execute. Lazy-loading per-topic content is the
big swing but RISKY (search/map/allQuestions/dailyConcept iterate `window.COURSES`); only attempt with a
shared "topics index" (id/title/blurb/color) loaded first + full lessons on demand. Not worth it yet.

## Improvement compass — rotate; broken always wins; biggest value first
1. **Content details** — depth, accuracy, missing sub-topics, new lessons/modules, worked examples.
2. **UI / UX** — layout, typography, spacing, color, polish, delight.
3. **Workflow / dev-flow** — tooling, the loop itself, gates, content pipelines.
4. **Visualizations** — new interactive widgets (`js/viz.js`), improve existing ones.
5. **Animations / juice** — motion, micro-interactions, transitions, fanfare.
6. **New functionality** — a new pillar or feature that raises the bar.
7. **Examples** — concrete, worked examples wherever a concept needs one.
8. **Understandability** — clearer explanations, onboarding, empty states, tooltips, glossary.
9. **Accessibility** — keyboard nav, ARIA, focus states, contrast, reduced-motion.
10. **Performance** — load time, render cost, lazy-loading.
11. **Mobile (390px)** — a release gate, not an afterthought.
12. **Gamification** — depth and motivation (without cheapening learning).

## Backlog (ideas — mine these; add as you discover more)
- AI tutor / infinite practice (opt-in, bring-your-own Claude API key). [owner deferred for now]
- ~~Glossary with hover-definitions of key terms across lessons.~~ **DONE iter 57** (inline `.gloss` tooltips in lecture prose).
- ~~"Explain it back" — free-text recall with self-grading (Feynman technique).~~ **DONE iter 53** (Recall tab; self-graded against the lesson's flashcards, feeds mastery + XP). Future: optional AI grading when the tutor lands.
- Per-concept difficulty rating + adaptive question selection in tests.
- ~~Interleaved review sessions (mix topics) beyond the SRS queue.~~ **partly DONE iter 68** — Daily Mix (`#/session`) chains due cards + a weak-spot quiz + a next lesson into one guided flow.
- More viz ideas (24 widgets now; overfitting iter 54, backprop graph iter 59, decoding iter 67, CLT iter 74,
  normal-explorer iter 76, covariance-scatter iter 79): MDP policy-iteration, a BPE-merge animation, a
  learning-rate-schedule plot, a confidence-interval coverage simulator (for the upcoming Estimation module).
- Lesson-embedded code exercises (`data-code` with `data-expected`) tied to each algorithm/DL lesson.
- Reduced-motion + high-contrast accessibility modes.
- ~~Search ranking improvements (fuzzy, recency, mastery-weighted) in ⌘K.~~ **fuzzy DONE iter 70** (typo-tolerant subsequence tier). Recency/mastery-weighting still open.
- Onboarding tour for first visit; better empty states everywhere.
- Audio: optional ambient focus soundscape (generative WebAudio, mute by default).
- Print/PDF a full lesson (not just cheatsheets).

## Cadence / anti-monotony (binding)
- Don't pick the **same compass area two iterations running** unless it's broken or owner-asked.
- Prefer the **biggest-value** move; a bold swing (new pillar, overhaul) beats a tidy tweak when warranted.
- **Broken always wins**: a real bug / console error / broken render preempts everything.

## Owner priority — question-bank growth sweep ✅ COMPLETE (iters 60–65)
Owner's most-repeated ask: "more and more and more questions … think again until I pass." Grew every lesson to
12 MCQs via author→adversarial-verify (verification was CRITICAL — a wrong answer key teaches the wrong thing;
the verify pass caught self-contradictory stems, ambiguous/duplicate correct choices, wrong keys, bad KaTeX).
DONE: LA (60, +64), Calculus (61, +88), Algorithms (62, +80), Deep Learning (63, +76), RL (64, +75, target-12
so thin lessons topped up), LLMs (65, +76). **Final: every one of the 113 lessons at exactly 12 MCQs; 1,356
site-wide (was 897).** Reusable tooling if more are ever needed: `/tmp/gen_mcq_target_wf.js <topicId> <noun>
<target>` → `Workflow` → `/tmp/inject_mcq.js <topicId> <out>` (appends + validates) → gate → quiz check.
→ **Both owner content sweeps are now COMPLETE** (examples 47–52, questions 60–65). Loop returns to the broader
compass (UI/viz/animations/gamification/understandability/accessibility/perf), rotating per anti-monotony.

## Owner priority — worked examples sweep ✅ COMPLETE (iters 47–52)
"Examples when we need it." Added 2 verified worked examples to every lesson that warranted them, all six
topics, via the author→adversarial-verify workflow. DONE: Linear Algebra (47), Calculus (48), Algorithms (49),
Deep Learning (50), Reinforcement Learning (51), LLMs (52). **Final: 108/113 lessons carry worked examples,
218 total** (the 5 without are purely-conceptual LA lessons the verifier correctly skipped).
→ **The loop now rotates back to the broader compass** — UI/UX, visualizations, animations, new functionality,
and gamification have been quiet since iter 46. Pick the biggest-value non-content move next (and honor
anti-monotony: content/examples ran 6 iterations straight under the owner-ask exemption).
Reusable pipeline if more content is ever needed: `/tmp/gen_examples_wf.js <topicId> <noun>` →
`Workflow({scriptPath})` → `/tmp/inject_examples.js <topicId> <outputFile>` → gate → all-routes → 390px.
Re-running the generator after a partial inject re-bakes ONLY the still-missing lessons (good for retries).
**Landmines from the sweep:** (1) matrix/token-heavy lessons (DL RNN+attention, LLM multi-head) STALL the
workflow author agent on all 6 retries (~3h wasted) — author those DIRECTLY with a `String.raw` node script
+ one verify Agent. (2) The generator's verify prompt said "no raw HTML", so some authors emitted markdown
`**bold**` which does NOT render (Examples tab uses innerHTML; KaTeX ignores `**`) — fixed 219 spans in
iter 52. If the pipeline is reused, make the author/verify prompts mandate `<strong>`/`<em>`, never markdown.

## Notes / discoveries
- **Architecture review (iter 36):** layer discipline is clean — content in `data/*.js`, visualizations in
  `js/viz.js` (818 ln, cohesive registry of 18 widgets), playground in `js/playground.js`, state + SM-2 +
  mastery in `js/store.js` (374 ln), all app/router/views in `js/app.js` (1381 ln), styles in `css/styles.css`.
  `js/app.js` is the only large file; it's ONE IIFE whose ~40 view/helper functions share closure vars
  (`app`, `esc`, `C`, `index`, `bindGo`, `typeset`, `flushAchievements`, …), so a split needs a shared-context
  object — high-coupling, partially unverifiable (render behavior), low immediate value. **Verdict: healthy;
  no clean+safe+worthwhile extraction now. Defer the shared-context split until app.js becomes painful** (the
  overlay layer — confetti/levelup/intro/palette/studyKeys — is the cleanest future leaf). `node gate.js`
  guards the data layer.
- **LaTeX-authoring convention (iter 77):** new lessons can be authored with a node generator that loads the
  existing course, builds lesson objects with `String.raw` + SINGLE-backslash LaTeX (`\frac`, `\operatorname`),
  pushes the new module, and rewrites the file as `header + "(window.COURSES...).push(\n" + JSON.stringify(course,
  null,2) + "\n);\n"`. KaTeX renders this correctly (verified katex-error=0 + visual). NOTE: the iter-71/73 lessons
  happen to carry DOUBLE backslashes in-memory and ALSO render fine — KaTeX is robust to both here — so don't be
  alarmed by the mismatch; single-backslash is the cleaner standard. Generator pattern saved at
  `/tmp/gen_ps_module3.js` (back up the data file first: `cp data/probability-statistics.js /tmp/ps_backup.js`).
