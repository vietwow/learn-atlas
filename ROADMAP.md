# Atlas — Roadmap

**North star:** the best *personal* learning site ever — for one motivated self-learner studying
linear algebra, calculus, algorithms, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and LLMs.
Optimize for: understanding faster, remembering longer, and *wanting* to come back.

The autonomous loop (`/improve-atlas`) reads this file first. Keep it the live queue:
done items move to CHANGELOG and out; new ideas land in the backlog.

## Now (highest priority)
- **INTEGRATE the comprehensive-content workflow output** (run `wf_acfb2503-efd`, author→adversarial-verify
  per lesson, generating full curricula for all 6 topics). When it lands:
  1. Write per-topic `data/<topic>.js` files (`(window.COURSES=window.COURSES||[]).push({...})`), remove `data/courses.js`.
  2. Update `index.html` script tags + `sw.js` `ASSETS` list, and **bump `CACHE` `atlas-v1`→`atlas-v2`**.
  3. Follow-up workflow: add cross-topic `prereqs` edges + expand the question bank + standalone `examples`.

## Improvement compass — rotate; broken always wins; biggest value first
1. **Content details** — depth, accuracy, missing sub-topics, new lessons/modules, worked examples.
2. **UI / UX** — layout, typography, spacing, color, polish, delight.
3. **Workflow / dev-flow** — tooling, the loop itself, gates, content pipelines.
4. **Visualizations** — new interactive widgets (`js/viz.js`), improve existing ones.
5. **Animations / juice** — motion, micro-interactions, transitions, fanfare.
6. **New functionality** — a new pillar or feature that raises the bar.
7. **Examples** — concrete, worked examples wherever a concept needs one.
8. **Understandability** — clearer explanations, onboarding, empty states, tooltips, glossary.
9. **Accessibility** — keyboard nav, ARIA, focus states, contrast, reduced-motion.
10. **Performance** — load time, render cost, lazy-loading.
11. **Mobile (390px)** — a release gate, not an afterthought.
12. **Gamification** — depth and motivation (without cheapening learning).

## Backlog (ideas — mine these; add as you discover more)
- AI tutor / infinite practice (opt-in, bring-your-own Claude API key). [owner deferred for now]
- Glossary with hover-definitions of key terms across lessons.
- "Explain it back" — free-text recall with self/AI grading (Feynman technique).
- Per-concept difficulty rating + adaptive question selection in tests.
- Interleaved review sessions (mix topics) beyond the SRS queue.
- More viz: PCA/eigenbasis, convolution, backprop graph, attention heatmap, MDP policy-iteration, Bayes.
- Lesson-embedded code exercises (`data-code` with `data-expected`) tied to each algorithm/DL lesson.
- Reduced-motion + high-contrast accessibility modes.
- Search ranking improvements (fuzzy, recency, mastery-weighted) in ⌘K.
- Onboarding tour for first visit; better empty states everywhere.
- Audio: optional ambient focus soundscape (generative WebAudio, mute by default).
- Print/PDF a full lesson (not just cheatsheets).

## Cadence / anti-monotony (binding)
- Don't pick the **same compass area two iterations running** unless it's broken or owner-asked.
- Prefer the **biggest-value** move; a bold swing (new pillar, overhaul) beats a tidy tweak when warranted.
- **Broken always wins**: a real bug / console error / broken render preempts everything.
