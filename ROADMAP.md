# Atlas — Roadmap

**North star:** the best *personal* learning site ever — for one motivated self-learner studying
linear algebra, calculus, algorithms, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and LLMs.
Optimize for: understanding faster, remembering longer, and *wanting* to come back.

The autonomous loop (`/improve-atlas`) reads this file first. Keep it the live queue:
done items move to CHANGELOG and out; new ideas land in the backlog.

## Now (highest priority)
- **OWNER ASK (2026-06-16): EVER-GROWING QUESTION BANK (ongoing, every iteration).** Mastery mode shipped
  (iter 6 — wrong answers re-queue until passed). Now the standing job: **keep adding MORE questions every
  iteration** — more MCQs per concept with varied phrasings/numbers/distractors so retries can't be rote-
  memorized. Target a few topics' lessons each pass; grow toward ~8–10 MCQs per lesson. (Wrong answers
  already lower mastery so weak concepts resurface in weak-spot tests & Concept-of-Day.)
  PROGRESS: Linear Algebra (iter 7) + Calculus (iter 8) done — 8/lesson. NEXT: algorithms,
  deep-learning, reinforcement-learning, llm (one per iteration via the baked-script MCQ workflow).
  After all 6 reach 8/lesson, INTERLEAVE other compass areas (viz, UI, a11y) so the loop stays well-rounded.
- More inline visualizations: build NEW widgets for high-value concepts that lack one
  (PCA/eigenbasis, convolution, attention heatmap, Bayes, MDP policy iteration) and embed them.

## Improvement compass — rotate; broken always wins; biggest value first
1. **Content details** — depth, accuracy, missing sub-topics, new lessons/modules, worked examples.
2. **UI / UX** — layout, typography, spacing, color, polish, delight.
3. **Workflow / dev-flow** — tooling, the loop itself, gates, content pipelines.
4. **Visualizations** — new interactive widgets (`js/viz.js`), improve existing ones.
5. **Animations / juice** — motion, micro-interactions, transitions, fanfare.
6. **New functionality** — a new pillar or feature that raises the bar.
7. **Examples** — concrete, worked examples wherever a concept needs one.
8. **Understandability** — clearer explanations, onboarding, empty states, tooltips, glossary.
9. **Accessibility** — keyboard nav, ARIA, focus states, contrast, reduced-motion.
10. **Performance** — load time, render cost, lazy-loading.
11. **Mobile (390px)** — a release gate, not an afterthought.
12. **Gamification** — depth and motivation (without cheapening learning).

## Backlog (ideas — mine these; add as you discover more)
- AI tutor / infinite practice (opt-in, bring-your-own Claude API key). [owner deferred for now]
- Glossary with hover-definitions of key terms across lessons.
- "Explain it back" — free-text recall with self/AI grading (Feynman technique).
- Per-concept difficulty rating + adaptive question selection in tests.
- Interleaved review sessions (mix topics) beyond the SRS queue.
- More viz: PCA/eigenbasis, convolution, backprop graph, attention heatmap, MDP policy-iteration, Bayes.
- Lesson-embedded code exercises (`data-code` with `data-expected`) tied to each algorithm/DL lesson.
- Reduced-motion + high-contrast accessibility modes.
- Search ranking improvements (fuzzy, recency, mastery-weighted) in ⌘K.
- Onboarding tour for first visit; better empty states everywhere.
- Audio: optional ambient focus soundscape (generative WebAudio, mute by default).
- Print/PDF a full lesson (not just cheatsheets).

## Cadence / anti-monotony (binding)
- Don't pick the **same compass area two iterations running** unless it's broken or owner-asked.
- Prefer the **biggest-value** move; a bold swing (new pillar, overhaul) beats a tidy tweak when warranted.
- **Broken always wins**: a real bug / console error / broken render preempts everything.
