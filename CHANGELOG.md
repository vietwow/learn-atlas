# Atlas — Changelog

Prepend new entries under this header. Include the loop-iteration number in the heading.

## iter 41 — Independent MCQ correctness audit: 0 errors found (content quality)
A second, independent adversarial pass over the question bank: a 6-agent workflow (one subject-expert
professor per topic) re-derived the answer to a 72-MCQ sample (≈12 per topic, spread across lessons) and
checked each for a wrong key, ambiguity, or a factual/explanation error. Result: **0 genuine problems
flagged** across all six topics — validating that the original generate→adversarial-verify pipeline produced
a correctly-keyed bank. No content changes needed; documented as a quality checkpoint.

## iter 40 — Advertise keyboard shortcuts in Test + Mastery modes (UX consistency)
Added the 1–4 / Enter `<kbd>` hints to the custom-test and mastery-drill progress lines (the shortcuts already
worked there since iter 24; now they're discoverable). Gate ALL GREEN.

## iter 39 — Show mastery in the lesson header (mastery model / UX)
Your grasp of a concept was visible on the course list but not while you studied it. The lesson header now
shows the mastery level + percent ("Learning · 42%") and a thin mastery bar (when you've practiced it), so
you always know where you stand on the page you're reading. Gate ALL GREEN, errs=0.

## iter 38 — Surface the Knowledge Map & Glossary on the dashboard (UX / discoverability)
The dashboard's quick-action row promoted Review/Test/Lab/Library but not two of the most useful pages.
Added 🗺️ Knowledge Map and 📔 Glossary so they're reachable in one tap from the home screen (they were only
in the sidebar / ⌘K). Gate ALL GREEN, errs=0.

## iter 37 — Visualization Lab links each widget to its lesson (understandability / navigation)
The Lab was a dead-end — you could play with a widget but not jump to where it's taught. Each lab card now
shows "↳ <lesson title>", and a widget's page has a "📖 Read the lesson: <title> →" button (plus the topic
link), resolved by scanning lesson content for the embedded `data-viz` id. All 18 widgets link correctly.
Gate ALL GREEN, errs=0.

## iter 36 — README brought current + architecture review (docs / maintenance)
Updated the stale README to the real platform (18 widgets, 20 achievements, 897 MCQs, Mastery mode, the radial
Constellation, glossary, keyboard shortcuts, connections, ranks ladder, SRS interval previews + forecast,
accessibility, the PWA update prompt, `gate.js`, and the live URL). Logged an architecture review in ROADMAP:
layers are clean, `app.js` is large but cohesive (one IIFE with shared closures), so the shared-context split
is deferred until it's painful. Docs-only at runtime; gate ALL GREEN.

## iter 35 — Review-load forecast on the Daily Review (spaced repetition)
Pairs with iter 34's interval previews: the Daily Review now opens with a forecast strip — due now / next 24h
/ next 7 days / cards in rotation — computed from each card's stored due date, so you can see your upcoming
workload and plan sessions. Verified: errs=0, gate ALL GREEN; with 2 cards graded forward the buckets read
676 due / 1 next-24h / 2 next-7-day / 2 in rotation, matching the schedule.

## iter 34 — Anki-style interval previews on flashcard grades (spaced repetition)
The Again/Hard/Good/Easy buttons gave no sense of *when* you'd see a card again. Each now shows its projected
next-review interval under the label (e.g. Hard 1d · Good 3d · Easy 5d), via a non-mutating `projectInterval`
that mirrors the SM-2 scheduler — so grading is informed, like Anki. Logic unit-tested clean (fresh→1/1/2,
then 3/3/5, then 8/8/8; Easy ≥ Good ≥ Hard always). Gate ALL GREEN, render errs=0.

## iter 33 — Relevance ranking in the ⌘K command palette (UX)
The palette indexes ~190 items (lessons, glossary terms, widgets, pages, references) but showed matches in raw
order. Added scoring — exact title match → title prefix → title contains → sub/category contains — so the best
hit leads. Searching "vector" now surfaces the Vector glossary term, then "Vectors and Vector Operations",
then the Vector Addition widget. Gate ALL GREEN, errs=0.

## iter 32 — Graceful PWA update prompt (distribution)
Since the loop ships to the live site constantly, installed/returning PWA users could sit on cached content.
The service worker now WAITS instead of skip-waiting on install, and the page detects an installed-but-waiting
worker and shows a small "✨ A new version of Atlas is available — Refresh" prompt; clicking posts SKIP_WAITING,
the worker activates, and `controllerchange` reloads once into the fresh build. First-time install/caching is
unchanged. Verified: gate ALL GREEN, sw.js parses, site loads errs=0 (SW is a no-op on file://; the flow
engages live on the next deploy).

## iter 31 — Hardening pass + a committed content gate (workflow / tooling)
A maturity checkpoint after 24 autonomous iterations: full regression audit — old-shape save migrates safely
(all numbers finite), and all 30 routes + 18 widgets render with errs=0 and zero viz-hydration failures.
Since the audit was clean, institutionalized it: added `gate.js` (run `node gate.js`) which validates the whole
data layer — no duplicate lesson ids, every MCQ answer in range, flashcards well-formed, every embedded
`data-viz` id is a real widget, every prereq id resolves. Prints a summary + ALL GREEN; the loop's Step-3
check now runs it. Current gate: 6 topics · 113 lessons · 897 MCQs · 678 flashcards · 18 widgets, all green.

## iter 30 — Reading text-size control (accessibility / reading comfort)
Long study sessions get an in-app text-size preference (A− / A / A+ in Settings) that scales the lesson prose
via a `--read-scale` CSS variable, persisted to localStorage and applied on boot — independent of UI chrome
and browser zoom. Verified: errs=0, A+ sets the scale to 1.15 and it sticks.

## iter 29 — New visualization: k-means clustering (visualizations)
Built algo-kmeans for the flagship unsupervised-learning idea. Three gaussian blobs; Lloyd's algorithm
alternates assign (color each point by nearest centroid) and update (move each centroid to its cluster mean),
animating to convergence with a live inertia readout and a k selector (2–4). Embedded in the Algorithmic
Foundations of ML lesson. Lab catalog 17 → 18. errs=0.

## iter 28 — Five milestone achievements for long-term goals (gamification)
The achievement set had no long-horizon goals. Added 5 (15 → 20): Mastery (80% on a concept), Module Master
(finish every lesson in a module), Renaissance (study all six topics), Centurion (review 100 flashcards),
and Devoted (30-day streak) — each wired to its real trigger in the store (mastery bump, lesson complete,
card grade, streak). Logic-tested: all fire from real actions; Achievements page renders 20, errs=0.

## iter 27 — "Connections" footer turns the dependency graph into in-lesson navigation (understandability)
Each lecture now ends with a Connections block: "Builds on" (the lesson's direct prerequisites, incl.
cross-topic ones) and "Leads to" (lessons that depend on it, computed as reverse edges) as color-coded
clickable chips. So from Backpropagation you can jump back to the Chain Rule & matrix multiplication, or
forward to DQN & policy gradients. Makes the knowledge graph usable while reading, not just on the map.
Verified: errs=0, both rows render with correct prereq/dependent links.

## iter 26 — New visualization: gradient descent in 2D (visualizations)
Built calc-gd2d — the optimization picture the 1-D widget can't show. An elliptical contour map of
$f=0.12x^2+y^2$ with the descent path animated down it; the elongated bowl makes the path visibly zig-zag
across the steep axis, and pushing the learning-rate slider past the curvature limit makes it diverge. Click
anywhere to drop a new start point. Embedded in the Gradient/Directional-Derivatives lesson. Lab catalog 16 → 17. errs=0.

## iter 25 — Ranks ladder on the Progress page (gamification)
The 10-rank journey (Novice → Polymath) was only ever glimpsed as the current rank in the topbar. Added a
full Ranks ladder to Progress: every rank with its XP threshold, reached ones lit with a gold badge, the
current one highlighted ("★ you are here"), and locked ones dimmed — so the path ahead is visible and
motivating. Verified: errs=0, 10 ranks render, current/reached/locked states correct (Student at 500 XP).

## iter 24 — Keyboard shortcuts for the study loop (UX / accessibility)
A single global key handler speeds up daily practice without touching the mouse: press 1–4 (or a–d) to
answer any MCQ (quiz, custom test, mastery drill), Space to flip a flashcard then 1–4 to grade it, and Enter
to advance/submit/continue. It ignores typing in inputs and yields to open modals. Discoverable via small
`<kbd>` hints in the quiz progress line and flashcard prompts. Verified: errs=0, a quiz driven purely by
keystrokes selects answers and advances.

## iter 23 — New visualization: RNN unrolling & memory (visualizations)
Built dl-rnn for the recurrent-network idea. The network is unrolled across 6 time steps (input → hidden →
output rows) with the recurrent edge h_{t-1}→h_t drawn explicitly and an animated pulse along the hidden
chain. An impulse enters at t=1 and the hidden state $h_t=\\tanh(w_x x_t + w_h h_{t-1})$ carries it forward,
decaying by the recurrence weight; a slider for $w_h$ shows short vs long memory. Embedded in the RNN/LSTM/GRU
lesson. Lab catalog 15 → 16. errs=0.

## iter 22 — Wire existing visualizations into more lessons (understandability)
Several lessons taught a concept an existing widget illustrates but didn't embed it. Added 5 inline embeds:
the eigenvector widget in Diagonalization, the sorting visualizer in Linear-Time Sorts, the derivative widget
in Differentiation Rules, and the gridworld in both Policies/Value-Functions and Policy-Iteration. errs=0,
all 4 spot-checked lessons hydrate their inline canvas.

## iter 21 — Worked examples now span all six topics (content)
Extended iter 18's Examples tab to every subject: 12 more worked examples across determinants, optimization
& gradient-descent intuition, binary search (a full trace + the O(log n) argument), SGD updates with a note
on momentum, a Bellman backup + why γ<1, and self-attention (attention as a weighted average + why ÷√dₖ).
Ten lessons now carry worked examples, at least one per topic. Verified: errs=0, RL & LLM Examples tabs
render with correct math.

## iter 20 — New visualization: Bayes' theorem & base rates (visualizations)
Built calc-bayes for one of the least-intuitive ideas in probability/ML. A 400-person grid splits into
true-positives (gold), false alarms (violet), missed cases (rust), true-negatives; sliders for base rate,
sensitivity, and specificity recompute it live and report P(condition | +). It makes the base-rate fallacy
visceral — at a 5% prior with a 90/90 test, only ~32% of positives are real. Embedded in the
Improper-Integrals (probability connections) lesson. Lab catalog 14 → 15. errs=0.

## iter 19 — "Continue where you left off" resume card (UX / retention)
Lowering the friction to return: the store now remembers the last lesson you opened (`lastLesson`), and the
dashboard surfaces a prominent "Continue" card (topic · module · lesson, with a Resume button) above the
Concept of the Day. Directly serves the "want to come back" goal. NaN-safe schema add. Verified: errs=0,
visiting a lesson then returning shows the card resolving to that exact lesson.

## iter 18 — Worked examples activate the Examples tab (content)
The per-lesson Examples tab existed but was empty. Hand-wrote 10 worked examples (problem → revealable
solution) across four flagship lessons: eigenvalues/eigenvectors (incl. a non-diagonalizable shear), the
chain rule (3 composites), dynamic programming (Fibonacci + coin-change, with why greedy fails), and
backprop (a numeric gradient through one weight + why activations are cached). KaTeX math incl. matrices.
Verified: errs=0, the Examples tab appears and the working reveals with correct rendering.

## iter 17 — Glossary of key terms (understandability / content)
Added a searchable Glossary (data/glossary.js): 48 hand-curated, plain-language definitions of the core
concepts across all six subjects (8 each — e.g. span, eigenvector, chain rule, Big-O, backprop, Bellman
equation, attention), with KaTeX math, topic-colored chips, and live search over term/definition/topic.
New "Glossary" nav item + route; every term is also searchable in the ⌘K palette. sw.js cache → atlas-v4.
Verified: errs=0, 48 terms render, search filters correctly.

## iter 16 — Flow reflection + responsive Knowledge Map on mobile (mobile / UI)
~10-iteration flow reflection: rotation is healthy (content 7–9 · viz 10/14/15 · a11y 11 · juice 12 ·
onboarding 13) and a 390px audit found the platform holds up well (intro, lessons, tests, widgets all
scale/stack). The one real weakness: the radial Knowledge Map was a fixed ~1450px SVG that forced awkward
panning on phones. Fix: on ≤760px the map SVG scales to fit the viewport (viewBox does the work), so the
whole constellation is visible at a glance; desktop keeps the large scrollable version. Verified: desktop
map errs=0 / 113 nodes unchanged, mobile map now fits the width.

## iter 15 — New visualization: convolution & feature maps (visualizations)
Built dl-convolution, the core CNN operation. An 8×8 input (a bright square) with a selectable 3×3 kernel
(vertical/horizontal edge, blur, sharpen, identity); Play/Step slides the receptive field cell-by-cell,
computing each feature-map value as Σ(kernel × patch) and coloring it green (+) / red (−) so edge kernels
visibly light up the square's borders. Embedded in the Convolution lesson. Lab catalog 13 → 14. errs=0.

## iter 14 — New visualization: PCA / principal components (visualizations)
Built la-pca, the LA→ML bridge concept. Tilt (angle) and stretch a 64-point data cloud; the widget computes
the covariance, finds its eigenvectors analytically, and draws PC1 (gold, max-variance axis) + PC2 (sage),
reporting the % variance PC1 captures. "Project onto PC1" drops a perpendicular from every point to the axis
(violet) — the literal 1-D dimensionality reduction. Embedded in the Low-Rank/PCA lesson. Lab catalog 12 → 13.
Verified: errs=0, widget renders and the projection path works.

## iter 13 — Onboarding: first-visit welcome tour (understandability)
A new learner now gets oriented instead of dropped into a feature-dense app. A first-visit modal introduces
Atlas and its four pillars — Learn (lessons + viz), Master (Mastery-mode tests), Navigate (Knowledge
Constellation), Build (Code Playground) — with the ⌘K tip and a save-is-local note; it shows once
(localStorage flag) and a sidebar "Guide / tour" button reopens it anytime. Esc/backdrop/CTA all close it.
Verified: errs=0, shows on first visit, reopens via Guide, no errors navigating after dismiss.

## iter 12 — Juice: level-up celebration + confetti (animations)
Added a delight beat. The store now detects level-ups (XP crossing a rank threshold) and queues them;
flushAchievements fires a centered "Level N · <rank name>" celebration modal with a 130-particle confetti
burst. Confetti also fires on a perfect (100%) quiz and on clearing a Mastery drill. All of it respects
prefers-reduced-motion (no-op when the user asks for less motion). Verified: errs=0; granting XP across the
150-point threshold pops the "Level 2 · Apprentice" celebration.

## iter 11 — Accessibility pass (accessibility)
Rotated to a neglected area. Added: a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query that disables reveals/transitions/
animations for users who ask for less motion; `:focus-visible` outlines on every interactive element
(nav, buttons, choices, cards, tabs) for keyboard users; a "Skip to content" link; `aria-current="page"`
on the active nav item; `aria-label`s on the icon-only menu button and nav landmarks; `aria-hidden` on
decorative glyphs; and a polite `aria-live` region for toasts so achievements are announced to screen readers.
Verified: all routes errs=0, aria-current + skip link working, no visual regression.

## iter 10 — Two new interactive visualizations: neural-net forward pass + attention heatmap (visualizations)
Interleaving off the question-bank run: built two widgets that filled the biggest viz gaps. **Neural Network
Forward Pass** (dl-neural-net) — drag 3 inputs, watch weighted sums → ReLU hidden → softmax outputs with
green/red signed edges and animated signal flow; embedded in the Neuron/MLP lesson. **Self-Attention Heatmap**
(llm-attention) — a 7-word sentence where each row is a word's attention over the others ("it" → "cat"),
hover to read weights; embedded in the DL attention lesson and the LLM self-attention lesson. Lab catalog
10 → 12. Verified: all routes errs=0, both widgets hydrate inline and in the Lab.

## iter 9 — Question bank: batched expansion of the remaining 4 topics (content / owner ask)
Finished the bank-doubling goal in one batched pass: a 150-agent author+verify workflow added ~4 new
adversarially-checked MCQs to each of the 75 lessons in algorithms, deep learning, RL, and LLMs — 293 added
(algorithms +80, deep-learning +76, RL +61, llm +76; duplicates auto-skipped). **Whole bank 604 → 897**, all
6 topics now ~8 MCQs/lesson. With Mastery mode, misses recur until passed. Verified: 0 bad indices, errs=0.
Next: the loop interleaves other compass areas (new visualizations, UI/a11y polish) now the bank goal is met.

## iter 8 — Question bank expansion: Calculus doubled to 176 MCQs (content / owner ask)
Continued the ever-growing-bank push: a 44-agent author+verify workflow added 4 new adversarially-checked
MCQs to each of the 22 Calculus lessons — 88 added (88 → 176, 8/lesson); whole bank 516 → 604. Verified:
0 bad indices, 0 dupes, all routes errs=0. (Workflow task-output was slow to flush, so results were also
reconstructed from the verify-agent transcripts as a cross-check — both matched.) Next topic: algorithms.

## iter 7 — Question bank expansion: Linear Algebra doubled to 128 MCQs (content / owner ask)
Owner wants an ever-growing bank so retries can't be memorized. Authored + adversarially verified (32-agent
workflow, every answer-index re-derived) 4 NEW MCQs per Linear Algebra lesson — 64 added across 16 lessons,
taking LA from 64 → 128 MCQs (8 per lesson) and the whole bank from 452 → 516. New questions are
non-duplicate, mix computational + conceptual, with misconception distractors. Verified: 0 bad indices,
0 dupes, all routes errs=0. (Loop will rotate to the next topic each pass.)

## iter 6 — Mastery mode: wrong answers re-queue until you pass (gamification / new functionality)
OWNER ASK — "think again until I pass, not casual remembering." The Spawn-a-Test page now has a default-on
**Mastery mode**: every question you miss goes to the back of the queue and keeps coming back until you
answer it correctly; the drill only finishes when ALL are mastered. Immediate feedback + explanation +
a "review the lesson" link on each miss, a live mastered-progress track, and a first-try-accuracy summary.
Each answer feeds the mastery model (wrong lowers it, so weak concepts resurface). Verified end-to-end:
errs=0, a drive that missed most first-tries re-queued and drained to ✓5/5 over 9 attempts.

## iter 5 — Runnable code exercises embedded in algorithm & DL lessons (examples / new functionality)
Added in-lesson `<div data-code>` exercises (Pyodide Python) with `data-expected` self-check badges: bubble
sort, binary search, and DP-Fibonacci in the algorithms lessons; a one-neuron forward pass and a numerical-
gradient (backprop building block) in the DL lessons. Code is HTML-escaped in storage so `<`/`>` survive
innerHTML and decode back to runnable source. Expected outputs verified against real python3. Verified:
syntax green, all routes errs=0, the embedded playground hydrates and the code decodes correctly.

## iter 4 — Interactive visualizations embedded inline in the lessons they illustrate (understandability)
Wired the 10 Lab widgets into 13 lessons across all 6 topics via `<div data-viz>` — e.g. the vector-add
widget now sits inside "Vectors and Vector Operations", the matrix-transform widget in "Matrices as Linear
Transformations" and "Determinants", gradient-descent in "Optimization" and the DL "Optimizers" lesson,
the gridworld in "Value Iteration", embeddings in the DL and LLM embedding lessons. Re-serialized each
per-topic data file (content preserved; idempotent). Verified: syntax green, all routes errs=0, the inline
canvas hydrates, math intact, legible at 390px. Now learners manipulate a concept right where they read it.

## iter 3 — Knowledge Map redesigned as a radial Constellation (UI / visualization)
Owner ask: make the map game-like. Replaced the 6-column layout with a radial skill-tree — a central glowing
ATLAS hub, the 6 subjects as colored sectors radiating outward (foundations near the core, advanced concepts
toward the rim), cross-topic prerequisites arcing through the middle, concentric guide rings, and rim labels.
Hovering a star lights its full dependency chain plus a caption; click opens it. Verified errs=0, 113 nodes, 6 sectors.

## iter 2 — Cross-topic prerequisite graph connects the 6 topics (content details / understandability)
Added data/prereqs.js (window.PREREQS): 40 hand-verified cross-topic edges (e.g. backprop → chain-rule +
matrix-multiplication; self-attention → attention-mechanism + dot-product; RLHF → policy-gradients + PPO;
LoRA → low-rank/PCA). app.js learningPath/directPrereqs now merge these with in-course ordering, so the
Knowledge Map links its columns (147 edges) and a path like "Self-Attention" traverses Linear Algebra →
Deep Learning → LLM from the beginning. All ids validated cross-topic; 9 routes errs=0.

## iter 1 — Comprehensive content integrated: 113 lessons across 6 topics (content details)
Replaced the 15-lesson seed with the workflow-generated, adversarially fact-checked curriculum:
**6 topics · 113 lessons · 452 MCQs · 678 flashcards · 337 homework problems** (212 verifier fixes applied).
Split content into per-topic data files (data/<topic>.js, push to window.COURSES); removed data/courses.js;
wired index.html script tags + sw.js ASSETS and bumped CACHE atlas-v1->v2. Verified: 25 routes errs=0,
lessons render with KaTeX math, Knowledge Map populated with all 113 concepts, 0 bad MCQ answer-indices,
0 duplicate lesson ids.


## iter 0 — Foundation (hand-built before the loop)
The base platform: a static, gamified, GitHub-Pages-ready personal learning site for 6 topics
(linear algebra, calculus, algorithms, deep learning, reinforcement learning, LLMs).

- **Core**: data-driven courses (`data/courses.js`), hash-router SPA (`js/app.js`), localStorage
  state with NaN-safe migrations (`js/store.js`), KaTeX math, "Ink"/"Parchment" themes.
- **Learning modes**: lectures, Examples tab, MCQ quizzes, SM-2 flashcards + global Daily Review, homework.
- **Mastery model**: decaying per-concept score → weak-spots, mastery distribution, map colors.
- **Knowledge Map**: SVG dependency graph of all concepts, colored by mastery, prereq edges.
- **Code Playground** (`js/playground.js`): Pyodide Python + JS, embeddable via `<div data-code>`.
- **Visualization Lab** (`js/viz.js`): 10 interactive canvas widgets, embeddable via `<div data-viz>`.
- **Spawn-a-Test**: custom exam from the question bank (scopes: mastered / weak / topic / all).
- **Learning paths**: prerequisite closure + in-course ordering.
- **Placement diagnostic**: marks known concepts, recommends a starting point.
- **Cheatsheets**: printable per-topic quick reference.
- **Concept of the Day**, **⌘K command palette**, per-lesson **notes**, **daily goal + activity heatmap +
  streak freezes**, **export/import progress**, **Library** of curated references, **PWA/offline**.
- Gamification: XP, 10 levels (Novice→Polymath), streak, 16 achievements.
- Verified: all routes render with 0 runtime errors in headless Chrome.

Seed content only (6 courses, 15 lessons) — the comprehensive-content workflow output is pending integration (see ROADMAP "Now").
