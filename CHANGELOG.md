# Atlas — Changelog

Prepend new entries under this header. Include the loop-iteration number in the heading.

## iter 13 — Onboarding: first-visit welcome tour (understandability)
A new learner now gets oriented instead of dropped into a feature-dense app. A first-visit modal introduces
Atlas and its four pillars — Learn (lessons + viz), Master (Mastery-mode tests), Navigate (Knowledge
Constellation), Build (Code Playground) — with the ⌘K tip and a save-is-local note; it shows once
(localStorage flag) and a sidebar "Guide / tour" button reopens it anytime. Esc/backdrop/CTA all close it.
Verified: errs=0, shows on first visit, reopens via Guide, no errors navigating after dismiss.

## iter 12 — Juice: level-up celebration + confetti (animations)
Added a delight beat. The store now detects level-ups (XP crossing a rank threshold) and queues them;
flushAchievements fires a centered "Level N · <rank name>" celebration modal with a 130-particle confetti
burst. Confetti also fires on a perfect (100%) quiz and on clearing a Mastery drill. All of it respects
prefers-reduced-motion (no-op when the user asks for less motion). Verified: errs=0; granting XP across the
150-point threshold pops the "Level 2 · Apprentice" celebration.

## iter 11 — Accessibility pass (accessibility)
Rotated to a neglected area. Added: a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query that disables reveals/transitions/
animations for users who ask for less motion; `:focus-visible` outlines on every interactive element
(nav, buttons, choices, cards, tabs) for keyboard users; a "Skip to content" link; `aria-current="page"`
on the active nav item; `aria-label`s on the icon-only menu button and nav landmarks; `aria-hidden` on
decorative glyphs; and a polite `aria-live` region for toasts so achievements are announced to screen readers.
Verified: all routes errs=0, aria-current + skip link working, no visual regression.

## iter 10 — Two new interactive visualizations: neural-net forward pass + attention heatmap (visualizations)
Interleaving off the question-bank run: built two widgets that filled the biggest viz gaps. **Neural Network
Forward Pass** (dl-neural-net) — drag 3 inputs, watch weighted sums → ReLU hidden → softmax outputs with
green/red signed edges and animated signal flow; embedded in the Neuron/MLP lesson. **Self-Attention Heatmap**
(llm-attention) — a 7-word sentence where each row is a word's attention over the others ("it" → "cat"),
hover to read weights; embedded in the DL attention lesson and the LLM self-attention lesson. Lab catalog
10 → 12. Verified: all routes errs=0, both widgets hydrate inline and in the Lab.

## iter 9 — Question bank: batched expansion of the remaining 4 topics (content / owner ask)
Finished the bank-doubling goal in one batched pass: a 150-agent author+verify workflow added ~4 new
adversarially-checked MCQs to each of the 75 lessons in algorithms, deep learning, RL, and LLMs — 293 added
(algorithms +80, deep-learning +76, RL +61, llm +76; duplicates auto-skipped). **Whole bank 604 → 897**, all
6 topics now ~8 MCQs/lesson. With Mastery mode, misses recur until passed. Verified: 0 bad indices, errs=0.
Next: the loop interleaves other compass areas (new visualizations, UI/a11y polish) now the bank goal is met.

## iter 8 — Question bank expansion: Calculus doubled to 176 MCQs (content / owner ask)
Continued the ever-growing-bank push: a 44-agent author+verify workflow added 4 new adversarially-checked
MCQs to each of the 22 Calculus lessons — 88 added (88 → 176, 8/lesson); whole bank 516 → 604. Verified:
0 bad indices, 0 dupes, all routes errs=0. (Workflow task-output was slow to flush, so results were also
reconstructed from the verify-agent transcripts as a cross-check — both matched.) Next topic: algorithms.

## iter 7 — Question bank expansion: Linear Algebra doubled to 128 MCQs (content / owner ask)
Owner wants an ever-growing bank so retries can't be memorized. Authored + adversarially verified (32-agent
workflow, every answer-index re-derived) 4 NEW MCQs per Linear Algebra lesson — 64 added across 16 lessons,
taking LA from 64 → 128 MCQs (8 per lesson) and the whole bank from 452 → 516. New questions are
non-duplicate, mix computational + conceptual, with misconception distractors. Verified: 0 bad indices,
0 dupes, all routes errs=0. (Loop will rotate to the next topic each pass.)

## iter 6 — Mastery mode: wrong answers re-queue until you pass (gamification / new functionality)
OWNER ASK — "think again until I pass, not casual remembering." The Spawn-a-Test page now has a default-on
**Mastery mode**: every question you miss goes to the back of the queue and keeps coming back until you
answer it correctly; the drill only finishes when ALL are mastered. Immediate feedback + explanation +
a "review the lesson" link on each miss, a live mastered-progress track, and a first-try-accuracy summary.
Each answer feeds the mastery model (wrong lowers it, so weak concepts resurface). Verified end-to-end:
errs=0, a drive that missed most first-tries re-queued and drained to ✓5/5 over 9 attempts.

## iter 5 — Runnable code exercises embedded in algorithm & DL lessons (examples / new functionality)
Added in-lesson `<div data-code>` exercises (Pyodide Python) with `data-expected` self-check badges: bubble
sort, binary search, and DP-Fibonacci in the algorithms lessons; a one-neuron forward pass and a numerical-
gradient (backprop building block) in the DL lessons. Code is HTML-escaped in storage so `<`/`>` survive
innerHTML and decode back to runnable source. Expected outputs verified against real python3. Verified:
syntax green, all routes errs=0, the embedded playground hydrates and the code decodes correctly.

## iter 4 — Interactive visualizations embedded inline in the lessons they illustrate (understandability)
Wired the 10 Lab widgets into 13 lessons across all 6 topics via `<div data-viz>` — e.g. the vector-add
widget now sits inside "Vectors and Vector Operations", the matrix-transform widget in "Matrices as Linear
Transformations" and "Determinants", gradient-descent in "Optimization" and the DL "Optimizers" lesson,
the gridworld in "Value Iteration", embeddings in the DL and LLM embedding lessons. Re-serialized each
per-topic data file (content preserved; idempotent). Verified: syntax green, all routes errs=0, the inline
canvas hydrates, math intact, legible at 390px. Now learners manipulate a concept right where they read it.

## iter 3 — Knowledge Map redesigned as a radial Constellation (UI / visualization)
Owner ask: make the map game-like. Replaced the 6-column layout with a radial skill-tree — a central glowing
ATLAS hub, the 6 subjects as colored sectors radiating outward (foundations near the core, advanced concepts
toward the rim), cross-topic prerequisites arcing through the middle, concentric guide rings, and rim labels.
Hovering a star lights its full dependency chain plus a caption; click opens it. Verified errs=0, 113 nodes, 6 sectors.

## iter 2 — Cross-topic prerequisite graph connects the 6 topics (content details / understandability)
Added data/prereqs.js (window.PREREQS): 40 hand-verified cross-topic edges (e.g. backprop → chain-rule +
matrix-multiplication; self-attention → attention-mechanism + dot-product; RLHF → policy-gradients + PPO;
LoRA → low-rank/PCA). app.js learningPath/directPrereqs now merge these with in-course ordering, so the
Knowledge Map links its columns (147 edges) and a path like "Self-Attention" traverses Linear Algebra →
Deep Learning → LLM from the beginning. All ids validated cross-topic; 9 routes errs=0.

## iter 1 — Comprehensive content integrated: 113 lessons across 6 topics (content details)
Replaced the 15-lesson seed with the workflow-generated, adversarially fact-checked curriculum:
**6 topics · 113 lessons · 452 MCQs · 678 flashcards · 337 homework problems** (212 verifier fixes applied).
Split content into per-topic data files (data/<topic>.js, push to window.COURSES); removed data/courses.js;
wired index.html script tags + sw.js ASSETS and bumped CACHE atlas-v1->v2. Verified: 25 routes errs=0,
lessons render with KaTeX math, Knowledge Map populated with all 113 concepts, 0 bad MCQ answer-indices,
0 duplicate lesson ids.


## iter 0 — Foundation (hand-built before the loop)
The base platform: a static, gamified, GitHub-Pages-ready personal learning site for 6 topics
(linear algebra, calculus, algorithms, deep learning, reinforcement learning, LLMs).

- **Core**: data-driven courses (`data/courses.js`), hash-router SPA (`js/app.js`), localStorage
  state with NaN-safe migrations (`js/store.js`), KaTeX math, "Ink"/"Parchment" themes.
- **Learning modes**: lectures, Examples tab, MCQ quizzes, SM-2 flashcards + global Daily Review, homework.
- **Mastery model**: decaying per-concept score → weak-spots, mastery distribution, map colors.
- **Knowledge Map**: SVG dependency graph of all concepts, colored by mastery, prereq edges.
- **Code Playground** (`js/playground.js`): Pyodide Python + JS, embeddable via `<div data-code>`.
- **Visualization Lab** (`js/viz.js`): 10 interactive canvas widgets, embeddable via `<div data-viz>`.
- **Spawn-a-Test**: custom exam from the question bank (scopes: mastered / weak / topic / all).
- **Learning paths**: prerequisite closure + in-course ordering.
- **Placement diagnostic**: marks known concepts, recommends a starting point.
- **Cheatsheets**: printable per-topic quick reference.
- **Concept of the Day**, **⌘K command palette**, per-lesson **notes**, **daily goal + activity heatmap +
  streak freezes**, **export/import progress**, **Library** of curated references, **PWA/offline**.
- Gamification: XP, 10 levels (Novice→Polymath), streak, 16 achievements.
- Verified: all routes render with 0 runtime errors in headless Chrome.

Seed content only (6 courses, 15 lessons) — the comprehensive-content workflow output is pending integration (see ROADMAP "Now").
