# REVIEW.md — Review & Refine phase ledger (iters 1158–~1257)

Owner-directed (2026-07-02): review and refine all existing content and visualizations.
**Standing audit (iter 1172):** 88 MCQ explains reference answer options by index/letter; numbering conventions are mixed (0-based/1-based/letters) and the quiz UI shows no numbers. The 6 worst (out-of-range or answer-maligning: la-matrix-derivative-identities q10, ps-random-variables q7, l-peft-lora q1, c-area-volume q7, rl-policies-values q8, rl-value-approximation q0) are fixed content-first as of iter 1172; the rest get verified/de-indexed when each lesson's review turn arrives.

## linear-algebra — lessons
- [x] la-vectors-operations — ✔ iter-1158 — added magnitude/norm preview section (examples used it before it was defined); aligned q11 terminology (tip-to-tail); all 16 MCQs + 3 hw + 3 examples arithmetic re-verified
- [x] la-dot-product-norms — ✔ iter-1158 clean — every number re-verified (worked example, cosines, 16 MCQs, hw, examples incl. arccos values); no changes needed
- [x] la-span-independence — ✔ iter-1159 — rewrote q10 muddled explain (counterexample now actually refutes the claims); all row-reductions/relations/code re-verified
- [x] la-basis-dimension — ✔ iter-1159 — q5+q7 had only 3 choices (added 4th distractors); inline determinant gloss at first use (was an unexplained forward ref to lesson 9); all coord/det computations re-verified
- [x] la-matrices-as-transformations — ✔ iter-1160 — e2 was an exact duplicate of the in-content worked example (same matrices, vector, answer); replaced with a rotation×reflection composition showing order picks the mirror (RF = y=x, FR = y=−x, Node-verified); everything else re-verified clean
- [x] la-matrix-multiplication — ✔ iter-1160 clean — all products/powers/examples re-verified (AB/BA worked example, R^2=−I ladder, non-square e1, matmul code 19 22 43 50); no changes

- [x] la-diagonalization — ✔ iter-1163 — e2 duplicated the in-content defective-shear example (same matrix; h1 already does the variant); replaced with a matrix-exponential stability example (decoupled modes, e^{λt}, x(t)→0) that gives the e^{At} dive worked numbers; A⁵/h0-A³/e0/e1 all re-multiplied

## calculus — lessons
- [x] c-functions-and-graphs — ✔ iter-1169 — e2 composed to the exact function e0 already analyzed (√(x−4), same domain twice in one tab); replaced with 1/(x²−9) — composition punching isolated holes vs an interval; inverse worked example, code, h0-h2 all verified

- [x] c-computing-limits — ✔ iter-1171 — q5 explain had its option numbering shifted by one (called the correct answer "option 0" and mislabeled the rest — the 4th and worst index-disease case, actively misleading); rewritten content-first; all limits/hw/examples verified (worked 6, 1/4, 2; h1=1/2; q9=3; q11=−2)
- [x] c-continuity — ✔ iter-1171 clean — three-part continuity contract, IVT examples (Dottie number h1, bisection e1 with g(1.5)=−0.125), jump classifications (h2, e2), q9 Darboux counterexample all verified; no changes
- [x] c-derivative-definition — ✔ iter-1173 — e2 duplicated the content's |x| corner analysis (4th appearance incl. q2 + card); replaced with the x^{1/3} vertical-tangent mode (sides agree on +∞ — a different failure), Node-verified; worked example, code, h0-h2, all 16 MCQs verified

- [x] c-chain-rule — ✔ iter-1174 — q8 explain maligned its own correct answer ("Choice 0 forgets the inner derivative" — choice 0 IS 6x·e^{3x²}); de-indexed. Code exercises (54 54; dual numbers 10/7), h0-h2 (incl. (7x³+3x²)/√(2x+1)), gradient-flow arithmetic (0.7³⁰≈2e−5) all verified
- [x] c-derivatives-special-functions — ✔ iter-1174 — q8 explain blamed "choices 0 and 3" with 3 its own answer (should be the product-of-derivatives and dropped-term distractors); de-indexed. Softplus→sigmoid h2, x^x e2 (4(ln2+1)≈6.77), P′(1)=120ln2≈83.2, sec²(π/4)=2 all verified. Note: e2 overlaps lesson-6 log-diff dive (same x^x) — tolerated, the h1 x^{sin x} complement differs
- [x] c-implicit-related-rates — ✔ iter-1175 clean — ladder −1.5 ft/s, cone 9/(4π), two-cars 50 mph, folium y′, origin slope −1, circle-slope perpendicularity check, code −0.75 all verified; no changes
- [x] c-extrema-curve-sketching — ✔ iter-1175 — h0 assigned the exact function e1 fully works (x⁴−4x³, same −27/inflections); replaced with x⁴−8x² (mins ±2→−16, max 0, inflections ±2/√3→−80/9, all Node-verified, even-symmetry cross-check). h1 (max 3/2, min −3), MVT-Lipschitz h2, e0/e2 verified. Noted: e2 supersets q8 (x³−3x on [0,2]) — tolerated reinforcement
- [x] c-optimization — ✔ iter-1176 clean — river-fence 5000 m², AM-GM min 4 at x=2, gradient-descent η<2/k geometric-recursion homework, e0-e2 (incl. 5×5 square) all verified; h0 (3-sided) vs e2 (4-sided) are distinct constraint structures, not dups; no changes
- [x] c-linearization-lhopital — ✔ iter-1176 clean — tan46°≈1.0349 underestimate (concave-up justification), pendulum 1%, ∞−∞→0 with Taylor cross-check, ∛8.12≈2.01, x^x→1, √4.1≈2.025 all verified; q2 (L'Hôpital inconclusive on oscillation) is a standout question. Noted: e1(a) near-dups q10 (sphere dV, different dr) — tolerated; no changes
- [x] c-antiderivatives — ✔ iter-1177 clean — two-stage IVP s(t)=t³+4t+1, disconnected-domain q10 (per-piece constants), sec²−tan²=1 constancy check, all integrals verified; e2 (n=−1 exception) reinforces q1/q15/c2 — intentional emphasis on the lesson's central subtlety; no changes
- [x] c-definite-integral-riemann — ✔ iter-1177 clean — h0 (definition→12, trapezoid check), h1 (net 4 vs total 5), h2 (−3 m, 23/3 m), e1 (definition→14), L/R/M comparison (1/5/2.5 vs 8/3), midpoint-concavity q9 all verified. Noted: ∫₀²x² runs through e0/e2/q8 as a running example — tolerated; no changes
- [x] c-fundamental-theorem — ✔ iter-1178 — q2 explain maligned its own answer ("choices 0 and 3 are false" with 0 the answer); q0 de-indexed while editing. h0 (1, 19/6), both-limits h1, e0 (10, trapezoid check), e1 (−2√π), avg-value e2 (3) all verified

- [x] c-area-volume — ✔ iter-1179 — h0 exactly duplicated e0 (y=6−x² vs y=x, identical 125/6 solution; 3rd homework=example case); replaced with the crossing-curves x³-vs-x problem (area ½, split at 3 intersections, exposes the signed-integral-equals-0 trap that card c0 warns about but nothing practiced; Node-verified). q7 already fixed iter-1172; washer-about-y=−1 e1 (104π/15), both-methods h1 (π/2), avg-value h2 (2/π) all verified

- [x] c-intro-differential-equations — ✔ iter-1181 — e2 solved the exact function q8 verifies (y=3e^{2t}) in a lesson saturated with y′=ky (q10/q13/c2/e0); replaced with a derivation of Newton's cooling by separation (the formula card c5 records and h1 uses but nothing derived; teaches the shifted-variable trick + reclaims the excluded equilibrium). h0 (√(2t²+9)), h1 (k≈0.0673, 45.5°C), h2 (22.9 yr) all verified
- [x] c-partial-derivatives — ✔ iter-1181 clean — h0 Clairaut, h1 (0.2 vs ln1.22≈0.1989), Laplace h2, e0 (7/24), e1 (tangent plane L=y, 0.2196), e2 (D_u=4.4, |∇f|=√20) all verified.

- [x] c-gradient-directional — ✔ iter-1182 clean — e0 (52/5), e1 (steepest descent −2√58, step (0.4,0.6) with loss 17→1.72 check), zero-direction e2, h0 (5√2/2), h1 (2√5), q8 (36/5) all verified. Collision check vs lesson-20 e2: that example previews this material on the canonical bowl — tolerated as motivation (q13 here is a 5-second sanity check, not a duplicate lesson); no changes
- [x] c-multivariable-optimization — ✔ iter-1182 clean — e0 ((0,3) min −9), e1 (cubic: (0,0) saddle, (1,1) min −1, det H=36xy−9), e2 (Lagrange xy→25), h0 (saddle w/ eigenvalues 6,−2), h1 (√5 on the circle), h2 (quartic: inconclusive Hessian, direct-reasoning min) all verified; e2/h1 are complementary Lagrange problems, not dups; no changes

- [x] c-gradient-descent-convergence — ✔ iter-1183 — SEVEN explains de-indexed/fixed, densest cluster on the site: q0/q1/q5/q6/q7/q9 maligned their own correct answers under scrambled numbering, q3 self-referenced. All arithmetic verified (κ=25, x₁=0.4/3.2, η-window (0,2/a), e0's 0.8^k contraction, e1's learning-rate sweep, h0-h2)
- [x] c-lagrange-multipliers — ✔ iter-1184 — FIRST ARITHMETIC ERROR of the phase: e0's re-solve check claimed 41 m of fence gives A≈210.25; actually λ=41/4=10.25, A=2λ²=210.125 (increase 10.125 ≈ λ=10 to first order). Corrected with the full computation. h0 (min 5), h1 (13, λ=½), SVM/KKT e1, envelope-theorem e2 all verified. Noted: e2 deepens lesson-22's xy problem (envelope theorem added) — tolerated as spaced deepening
- [x] c-duality-kkt — ✔ iter-1184 clean — dual derivation h1 (g(λ)=2λ−λ²/4→d*=4=p*), the worked dual + code (gap 0), weak-duality proof h0, KKT verification e0, conjugate dive all verified; later-authored, tight throughout; no changes
- [x] c-proximal-projected — ✔ iter-1185 clean — soft-threshold code ([1.5,0,0,−0.8,0], 3 zeros), ISTA e1 ((0.6,0,−0.8)), h1 ((0.7,0,0)), ℓ1-vs-ℓ2 prox h2, Frank-Wolfe/mirror-descent dives all verified; no changes. ALL 27 CALCULUS LESSONS DONE.
